哈喽欢迎回到前进前十趴
Hello, welcome back to Top 10 Forward!
今天请到的是EZGO的
Today, we have with us one of the big bosses of EZGO,
大老板之一Alex
Alex.
哈喽大家好
Hello, everyone!
我先开始先跟大家介绍一下
Let me start by introducing
这个我跟Alex认识的过程好了
how I got to know Alex.
就是Alex跟他老婆Cathy呢
So, Alex and his wife Cathy,
基本上都算是我的客人吧
are basically my clients.
对
Right.
就是我们一开始是透过Eric认识的嘛
We first met through Eric, right?
然后他们跟我拿了几台车
Then they got a few cars from me.
然后之后我们因为小孩差不多大
Later, since our kids are around the same age,
在2020年那时候
back in 2020,
我小孩子才大概六个月好像
my child was probably about six months old,
就很小的时候
really young at the time.
跟Aden差不多大
About the same age as Aden.
然后Eric小孩也差不多大
And Eric’s kid was also around the same age.
所以我们会一起参加一些朋友的聚会
So we’d attend some friends’ gatherings together.
但是Alex这个人呢
But Alex, this guy,
我今天真的非常非常开心
I’m really, really happy today
可以请到他
to have him here.
原因是什么就是因为
The reason is,
我非常非常喜欢他
I really, really like him.
虽然说我跟他当时就是不熟
Even though we weren’t close back then,
但是我们每一次在这个家庭聚会的时候
every time at these family gatherings,
不管是这个baby shower啊
whether it’s a baby shower
或者是某个小朋友的生日啊
or a kid’s birthday party,
那我看到Alex都是
I’d always see Alex
真的是默默在带著小孩
quietly taking care of the kids.
就是
Like,
Cathy可能会忙著跟大家social
Cathy might be busy socializing with everyone,
然后Alex就在旁边
and Alex would just be there,
因为我老婆比较会social
since my wife is better at socializing.
所以social的部分就交给他这样子
So she handles the social part like that.
但是我觉得就是
But I think,
因为我见过非常非常多不同的人
having met so many different people,
就是各种阶层的人都有
from all walks of life,
然后一般来讲就是
generally speaking,
很少有就是很成功的男生
it’s rare to see a successful man
然后在带小孩又是这么上心的情况
who is also so dedicated to childcare.
我觉得某种程度跟我蛮像的
I feel like, in a way, we’re quite similar.
因为我自己我也是非常非常重视
Because I also place a lot of importance
陪小孩的时间啊这些东西
on spending time with my kids and such.
所以虽然说我们平常没有说
So even though we don’t usually
在聚会里面聊太多的天
chat much at gatherings,
但是我一直就是很喜欢你
I’ve always really liked you.
我也跟我老婆说我一直很喜欢Alex
I’ve even told my wife I really like Alex.
哇我觉得这男人
Wow, I think this man
我的荣幸
It’s my honor.
所以Alex现在他是EZGO的
So, Alex is now with EZGO,
其中一个老板之一
one of the owners.
然后跟他老婆一起经营这个公司
He runs the company with his wife.
EZGO算是
EZGO is,
应该算南加这边最大的
I think, the largest
华人物流公司了吧
Chinese logistics company in Southern California.
对寄台湾的部分
Yes, for shipments to Taiwan.
我们已经经营10年了
We’ve been in business for 10 years.
所以我们就是专门在做这个
So we specialize in this area,
小包裹寄往台湾
sending small packages to Taiwan.
和台湾寄来美国的服务
and services for shipping from Taiwan to the US.
听起来好像是一个很小的生意
It might sound like a small business,
但是我去他们公司的时候
but when I visited their company,
我是直接被震撼到了
I was completely blown away.
因为超大的
It's massive!
我不知道那个应该是有个几万尺吧
I’m not sure, but it must be tens of thousands of square feet.
三万三万尺
33,000 square feet.
反正就是非常非常大的一个仓库
Anyway, it’s an incredibly huge warehouse.
然后规模也是非常非常大
And the scale is just enormous.
公司很漂亮很干净这样
The company is beautiful and very clean.
所以Alex你今天是
So, Alex, today,
你是富二代吗
are you a second-generation rich kid?
还是你怎么走到这一刻的
Or how did you get to this point?
没有我们是白手起家
No, we started from scratch.
其实我们创业的故事还蛮艰辛的
Actually, our entrepreneurial journey was quite tough.
我们是从车库开始做
We started in a garage.
我们第一票货是从车库开始做
Our first shipment was handled from a garage.
你说家里自己的garage
You mean your own home garage?
对家里自己的garage开始做
Yes, we started in our own home garage.
在2015年的时候出了第一批货
We shipped our first batch in 2015.
OK那当时是怎么接触到
Okay, so how did you get into
物流这个行业的
the logistics industry?
我一直都是从事这个物流产业
I’ve always been in the logistics field.
然后就是在因缘际会之下
And then, by a stroke of fate,
我就自己成立了公司这样子
I started my own company.
OK对对对
Okay, got it.
然后一开始是从怎么从
So how did you go from
车库变到我看到的那个东西
a garage to what I saw at your company?
就我们一开始就从车库嘛
Well, we started in the garage,
那因为我一直有一些
and because I had some
就是比较
pretty good
好的这个客人的connection
connections with clients,
那他们就是会来找我
they came to me
就知道我自己创业以后
after learning I started my own business.
他们就来找我做
They approached me for work.
那我们就觉得在车库做是行不通的
Then we realized working from a garage wasn’t sustainable.
那我们就去租一个很小很小的仓库
So we rented a very small warehouse.
OK
Okay.
那时候仓库就只有1000尺
Back then, the warehouse was just 1,000 square feet.
1000尺大概就
1,000 square feet is about
可能就是正常一个客厅的大小吧
the size of a typical living room.
1000尺可能大概3020几坪左右
1,000 square feet is roughly 30 to 32 pings.
对然后那个office就小到不行
Yeah, and the office was incredibly tiny.
然后我们非常的
And we were extremely
就是起早贪黑啊
hardworking, burning the midnight oil.
就是我们就是早上6点
We’d start at 6 in the morning,
我就要开著货车出去收货
and I’d drive the truck to pick up shipments.
然后回来就开始不断的做
Then I’d come back and keep working non-stop,
就不断的理包裹啊
sorting packages endlessly.
打包啊然后
Packing them, and then
你有自己开过货车吗
have you driven a truck yourself?
对我早期都是
Yes, in the early days, I did everything.
业务兼driver
Sales and driver,
兼就是所有东西这样子
handling everything myself.
就是你做所有的事情
So you did everything.
所有的事情
Everything.
然后我老婆就是当然是
And my wife, of course,
我人生的贵人啦
is the greatest blessing in my life.
他就是没有他的话
Without her,
就不会有这间公司
this company wouldn't exist.
因为他很鼓励我去创业
She really encouraged me to start my own business.
那我们就创业的这个路上呢
On this entrepreneurial journey,
他也一直不断的扶持我
she has always supported me.
他从一个什么都不会
She started knowing nothing,
他就是从什么都不会的
absolutely nothing at first.
他就先帮我做做财务啊
She began by helping with finances,
做做报表啊然后
preparing reports, and
做做一些打杂office打杂的东西
doing miscellaneous office tasks.
然后到现在这样子
And now, look at her,
是我们公司的CFO
she's our company's CFO.
就基本上
Basically,
合约啊或厂商啊洽谈啊
contracts, vendors, negotiations—
都是他跟我一起出面这样子
she handles them with me.
所以Cathy他是没有接触过
So, Cathy had no experience
物流产业
in the logistics industry.
从来没有他以前
Never, not before.
对他以前他做过很多
She had done many things before,
对他做过家具他做过房地产
like working in furniture and real estate.
但是他没有做过物流产业
But never logistics.
大家不用担心
Don't worry, everyone.
因为我Alex跟Cathy
Because with Alex and Cathy,
我打算随他们两集
I plan to follow their story.
就是接下来我会邀请到Cathy上来
Next, I'll invite Cathy to join us.
因为我觉得他们两个都
I think both of them
各有各自非常非常特别的特色
have very unique and special traits.
他有一个很独特的personality
She has a very distinct personality.
哇我都不知道
Wow, I had no idea.
但我记得那时候Cathy有跟我讲过
But I remember Cathy once told me
说你们创业初期的时候
that during the early days of starting up,
真的是非常非常惨
it was really, really tough.
然后是住在一个
You were living in a
好像是一个雅房之类的
small rented room or something,
然后只有一个床还在地上
with just a mattress on the floor,
然后每天要吃泡面什么
eating instant noodles every day.
稍微分享一下这个故事
Can you share a bit of that story?
在那个是
Well, that was
那个还不是在创业初期啦
not exactly during the early startup phase.
那个是在创业之前
That was before starting the business.
就是我我是
You see, I...
我从台湾到美国的这个过程呢
My journey from Taiwan to the U.S.
其实我还蛮艰辛的
was quite challenging.
因为我是当完兵才来的
I came here after completing military service.
哦所以比较晚
Oh, so a bit later.
你没有在这边读书
You didn’t study here earlier?
对我没有在这边
No, I didn’t.
我在这边念大学
I did attend university here,
但我没有在这边念高中对
but not high school, right.
OK
OK.
那我我的情况是这样子
So my situation was like this:
我在台湾的时候
Back in Taiwan,
我曾经在那个咖啡厅上班
I used to work at a café.
那本来就是打工性质
It was just a part-time job.
然后打工到我要到
I worked there until I had to
收到兵单的时候
receive my military draft notice.
我就后来就很沮丧
I felt really down about it.
因为我之前是在美国游学了半年
Because before that, I had studied abroad in the U.S. for half a year.
然后就被叫回去当兵了嘛
Then I was called back to serve in the military.
那被叫回去当兵以后
After being called for military service,
就是这个过渡在咖啡厅上班
I was working at a café during the transition.
然后上到要当店经理的时候呢
And just when I was about to become a store manager,
就收到兵单了
I received my draft notice.
哦
Oh.
对然后就被抓去当兵
Yeah, then I was dragged off to the military.
那我在到美国的时候
When I arrived in the US,
我是其实是一个英文字都不会
I actually didn’t know a single English word.
就是我从A念到Z都有困难
I even struggled to read from A to Z.
真的假的
Seriously?
对就是英文非常非常的差劲
Yeah, my English was absolutely terrible.
那你是怎么在那么短时间
So how did you manage in such a short time?
对然后我在当兵的时候
Yeah, and during my military service,
我就是每天就是
I would, every day,
晚上会就大家在睡觉的时候
while everyone else was sleeping at night,
我就开始申请那个加班夜读
I’d apply for overtime to study late.
然后就念那个英文
Then I’d study English,
然后念到大概12点
until around midnight,
然后才去睡觉
and then go to sleep.
那睡到可能两三点就起来要站哨
I’d sleep until maybe 2 or 3 a.m., then get up for guard duty.
站到四点然后再回去睡
Stand guard until 4 a.m., then go back to sleep.
睡到五点然后就起来操课这样
Sleep until 5 a.m., then get up for drills.
哦所以你也是曾经睡一个小时
Oh, so you’ve also slept just one hour a day?
一天睡一个小时的人
Yeah, a person who slept one hour a day.
对我有看Andy的那个
Yeah, I’ve seen Andy’s story.
我觉得我很敬佩他
I really admire him.
就每天只睡一个小时
Sleeping only one hour a day.
我没有那么厉害
I’m not that extreme.
但我平均睡眠时间大概
But my average sleep time was probably
以前年轻的时候大概四个小时
about four hours when I was younger.
哦那也是非常强
Oh, that’s still impressive.
那现在比较多
Now it’s a bit more.
现在大概六到七个小时这样
Now it’s about six to seven hours.
OK那后来是什么因缘机会
OK, so what opportunity brought you
又来到美国了
back to the US?
那就是因为我一直很想
Well, I always really wanted
回来美国这个地方嘛
to come back to the US.
然后因为我就觉得我
And because I felt that
因为在台湾的话
if I stayed in Taiwan,
我觉得这个我是一个很叛逆的孩子
I felt I was a very rebellious kid.
在那时候
Back then.
Me too
Me too.
对我觉得台湾的
Yeah, I felt that Taiwan’s
整个教育体系也好
education system and
或者是社会制度也好
social structure
都是被套路的
were very restrictive.
就我当下我会觉得说
At the time, I felt like
我在过著跟每个人一样的人生
I was living the same life as everyone else.
因为the best chance就是说
Because the best path was, they say,
你就是男生的话就是你念建中
if you’re a guy, you go to Jianguo High School,
然后上台大然后可能
then National Taiwan University, and maybe
念个医或当个医生当个律师
study medicine or become a doctor or lawyer.
这就是你最好的出路了
That’s your best way out.
但我觉得这不是我想要过的人生
But I felt that wasn’t the life I wanted.
那我觉得在美国它是一个
I thought the US was a
自由的领土嘛
land of freedom.
就是你可以
Where you can
也没有说到你可以读what
It's not like you can study
ever you want
whatever you want,
但是就是你可以做自己想做的事情
but you can do what you want to do.
就是你今天你甚至
Even if today,
就行行可以出状元
any profession can lead to success.
就哪怕你今天做水电工
Even if you're a plumber today,
哪怕你今天做cable
or even if you work with cable,
那时候还有cable啦
back then, there was still cable work.
现在当然比较少
Of course, it's less common now.
对但是在各行各业
But in every industry,
你都可以出人头地这样
you can still make a name for yourself.
所以后来认识
So later on, I met
那你是怎么认识Cathy的
How did you meet Cathy?
Cathy的话就是也是朋友的
Cathy was through a friend.
就是他有我参加一次他的生日party
I attended her birthday party once.
对然后后来就遇到了
Yeah, and then we met.
哇那我觉得真的
Wow, I really think
我去Cathy也是我非常非常敬佩的人
Cathy is someone I deeply admire.
因为原因是什么就是因为
The reason being,
我的老婆Vanessa
my wife Vanessa,
就是他认识我的时候
when she met me,
我也是在一个基本上是最糟的状态
I was basically at my lowest point.
然后我们
And we,
那时候我也是dating
back then, I was also dating,
跟他dating的时候
when I was dating her,
就吃饭都要AA
we had to split the bill for meals.
然后也没有都要AA
Well, not always split,
就我可能出了几餐
I might have paid for a few meals,
然后就觉得靠
and then I’d think, wow,
就没有办法支撑住
I can’t keep this up.
真的是没有钱
I really had no money.
然后喝个饮料
Even buying a drink,
可能请他几次
maybe treating her a few times,
然后我就觉得哇
and then I’d think, wow,
他怎么都不出钱
why doesn’t she ever pay?
所以我们当时在一起的时候
So when we first got together,
一开始在金钱上
at the beginning, financially,
我觉得我们出现了很多的争执
I think we had a lot of arguments.
那你们有遇过这样的一个时期吗
Did you go through a period like that?
我们没有争执
We didn’t argue.
他一路倒是都是很支持我
She’s always been very supportive of me.
因为我跟他认识的时候
Because when I met her,
我是没房没车
I had no house, no car,
甚至连工作都没有
not even a job.
因为那时候我打算就是
Because at that time, I planned to,
我那时候已经辞掉我的工作
I had already quit my job,
然后我想要去念master这样
and I wanted to pursue a master's degree.
然后我试图也想要考药剂师
I also tried to become a pharmacist,
但我后来发现就是读书
but I later realized studying
可能不是我的强项嘛
might not be my strength.
对然后我也就是考了GMAT
Yeah, and I also took the GMAT,
然后成绩也不是很好
but my scores weren’t great.
对所以后来就又回去上班这样子
So eventually, I went back to work.
所以变成上是有点像是Cathy
So it’s kind of like Cathy
推著你去创业这条路
pushed you toward entrepreneurship.
创业这条路的话
As for entrepreneurship,
对算是就是算是他
yeah, it was sort of her,
算是他有push我
sort of her pushing me.
我说你都做那么久了
I said you've been doing this for so long,
那你可以自己做
why not do it on your own?
那直到我们创业的时候
And when we started our business,
我本来觉得我已经懂很多了
I thought I already knew a lot.
因为我在这个产业做了
Because I had worked in this industry
在工作上的话做了六年
for six years on the job.
对那我觉得我已经懂很多了
Yeah, I thought I knew a lot.
但创业直到创业那刻
But when we actually started the business,
我才发现其实我什么都不懂
I realized I didn’t know anything.
那我们就全部重新来过这样子
So we had to start over from scratch.
超屌的
Super impressive.
OK那Alex你做的是物流业嘛
OK, Alex, you’re in the logistics industry, right?
那我觉得物流业跟全球经济
I think logistics is closely tied
应该都是有很大的关系
to the global economy.
是的是的
Yes, yes.
那现在这个2025年8月底
Now, at the end of August 2025,
你现在觉得全球经济的状态
what do you think the state of the global economy is?
是处在什么样一个状态
What’s your take on it?
然后有什么可以跟大家分享的吗
And is there anything you can share with everyone?
就是世界上最的三大流量
The three biggest flows in the world
就是人流金流跟物流
are human flow, financial flow, and logistics.
那在疫情的时候
During the pandemic,
因为已经人流被卡死了
human flow was completely blocked.
就你人不能出国
You couldn’t travel abroad.
所以你就剩下金流跟物流
So, only financial flow and logistics remained.
也就是相对证明说在那个时期
This relatively proved that during that time,
金流是很旺盛的
financial flow was very strong.
就是资金在市场上的资金
The funds in the market
是用不完
were inexhaustible.
然后物流方面当然也是
And of course, in terms of logistics,
就是美国不管美国或亚洲也好
whether in the US or Asia,
他们在这个资源上都很稀缺
resources were very scarce.
因为尤其是这个防疫的部分嘛
Especially in the area of pandemic prevention.
对就是这个医疗用品的部分
Yeah, particularly medical supplies.
那所以就在这个时候经济
So, at that time, the economy
它supposedly它是应该要
was supposedly supposed to
遇到一个金融危机的
face a financial crisis.
因为我们都说金融危机
Because we often say financial crises
大概每12年10到12年会发生一次
happen roughly every 10 to 12 years.
那在上一次发生的时候
The last one was
是2008年的金融海啸
the 2008 financial crisis.
那在2020年的时候
And in 2020,
刚好就是完美12年
it was exactly 12 years later.
对就是supposedly
Yeah, supposedly,
他是要发生金融海啸了
a financial crisis was due.
但是也也确实发生了股灾嘛
And indeed, a stock market crash did happen.
在那个时期确实发生了股灾
There was a crash during that period.
但我觉得现在整个社会的
But I think the entire societal
整个社会的金融体系已经改变
financial system has changed.
那所以就是说他这个股灾并没有
So, this stock market crash didn’t
就应该说他股灾完以后
I mean, after the crash,
他很快也就恢复了
it recovered very quickly.
他并没有像08年这样子
It wasn’t like in 2008,
他从事了非常久的时间
where it took a very long time.
你觉得这个会不会是因为
Do you think this is because
08年的教训造成的
of the lessons learned from 2008?
我觉得是对我相信
I think so, yes, I believe
就是政府在这方面
the government in this aspect
他有去做他的变更嘛
They made changes to it, right?
那我觉得他们已经把
I think they've already turned
这个金融危机已经变成说
this financial crisis into something
他们有另外一个方式去处理
they handle in a different way.
疯狂印钱
Printing money like crazy.
对就是疯狂印钱
Yeah, just printing money like crazy.
也就是说为什么我现在
That's why right now,
我现在看到你的加密货币的
when I see your cryptocurrency channel,
这个频道我会非常认同
I really agree with it.
因为我觉得这个
Because I think
现在纸钞货币的这个金融体系
the current paper currency financial system
正在崩坏
is collapsing.
那他现在的就是市场不够钱
So now, when the market lacks money,
那我就印钱去处理
they just print more to deal with it.
就可以完美解决这个金融危机
It perfectly solves the financial crisis.
所以这真的是一个
So this is really
我觉得是个无底洞
a bottomless pit, I think.
有点像是一个
It's kind of like
怎么讲有毒瘾的人嘛
how to say, someone with a drug addiction.
你今天你不打你就死了
If you don't take it today, you die.
因为你能选择的情况下
Because when you have the choice,
你一定会继续打
you'll definitely keep taking it.
是的是的这个这个比喻相当好
Yes, yes, this analogy is quite good.
因为以往的金融危机
Because in the past, financial crises
都是采用这个自然疗法
were handled with a natural approach.
就是说他就是让市场慢慢的去恢复
Meaning, they let the market recover slowly on its own.
那现在的金融危机就是说
But now, with financial crises,
OK好你市场缺钱
it's like, okay, the market lacks money,
那我就印钱
so I'll just print more.
对那印到后来你就会
Yeah, and in the end, after printing so much,
变成无力偿还嘛
you become unable to repay it.
但是美国似乎已经找到
But it seems the U.S. has found
他的这个解决的方式了
a way to solve this.
那他最也就是为什么现在
That's also why now
会有一个这个关税战的这个发生嘛
there's this tariff war happening.
因为他这个不会无来由的
Because it’s not without reason
去打这个关税战
that they’re fighting this tariff war.
那其实在这个贸易的环节
In the trade process,
应该是你攻击国跟你的
it should be the exporting country and
这个购买国啊
the importing country,
他的这个关系是要
their relationship should
就是一直长久维持下去
be maintained long-term.
美国这个游戏才玩得起来
Only then can the U.S. keep playing this game.
那会打这个贸易战是因为
The reason for the trade war is
中国已经在开始脱钩了
that China has started to decouple.
因为你supposedly你
Because supposedly,
从美国赚到的钱
the money you earn from the U.S.
你要回资金要回流回来
should flow back as capital,
买美国的国债买美国的资产
to buy U.S. bonds and assets.
那美国才有能力再继续购买
Only then can the U.S. keep buying
购买你的商品嘛
your goods, right?
那现在的问题是
Now the problem is,
中国还是不断的在制造他的商品
China keeps producing its goods,
那他需要强大的购买力
and it needs strong purchasing power.
或许只有全世界只有美国
Perhaps only the U.S. in the world
可以办到这件事情
can manage this.
那美国他继续购买的情况之下
And as the U.S. keeps buying,
他的国债越来越高
its national debt keeps rising.
那借他最多钱的人就是中国
And the one lending the most money to them is China.
那但是中国这个
But China, in this case,
他收赚了美国的钱以后
after earning money from the U.S.,
他不去投资美国
doesn't invest it back into the U.S.
他去发展他的高科技
Instead, they develop their high-tech industries.
他想要去取代这个
They aim to replace
美国在全球的地位
the U.S. position globally.
那就造成这个今天美国
This has led to the U.S. today
一直不断针对中国
continuously targeting China
来去进行一个打压
and taking actions to suppress them,
来去进行一个关税制裁的动作
including imposing tariff sanctions.
我觉得你有没有发觉就是
Have you noticed something?
从电车这点其实可以蛮明显的
It's quite obvious with electric vehicles.
对
Yes.
就是中国的电车现在做的是超级好
China's electric vehicles are now incredibly well-made
然后又很便宜
and very affordable.
是
Exactly.
然后如果这些中国的电车
And if these Chinese electric vehicles
可以出口到我们就说欧美地区好了
can be exported to, say, Europe and the U.S.,
基本上所有的车行
basically all car manufacturers,
就传统车行包含了特斯拉
traditional ones including Tesla,
包含了奥迪宾士宝马这些车行
as well as Audi, Mercedes, and BMW,
都会被直接打趴
would be completely crushed.
对没错
Exactly.
所以他们现在就在控制这件事情
So they're trying to control this now.
对因为他分分钟他的
Yes, because in no time,
不管是科技也好人才也好
whether it's technology, talent,
或是国家资源
or national resources,
他没有一项是输美国的
China isn't lagging behind the U.S. in any aspect.
那他唯一缺乏的就是
The only thing they lack
人民币在全球的地位
is the global status of the yuan.
那这一点他们也是不断的
And they're continuously working
在去做一些政策上的这个调整
on policy adjustments for this.
对他们就是结合东南亚各国
Yes, they're collaborating with Southeast Asian countries
来去实行一个他们希望的人民币
to implement the yuan as they envision,
就像之前那个BRIC一样嘛
similar to the BRICS initiative before.
就是他们在推行的那个BRIC
It's the BRICS they're promoting,
就是跟俄国啊还有印度啊
partnering with Russia, India,
还有一些国家组成另外一个
and other countries to form another
货币的联盟
currency alliance.
所以其实美国相对来讲
So, relatively speaking,
是非常紧张
the U.S. is very nervous.
那美国之所以今天会这么强大
The reason the U.S. is so powerful today
是因为经历了第一次第二次世界大战
is due to the First and Second World Wars.
那在全球这个在资源非常匮乏的时候
During a time of global resource scarcity,
就是美国就是成为一个经济强体嘛
the U.S. emerged as an economic powerhouse.
因为大家生产力
Because everyone's productivity,
在工业革命以后生产力过剩
after the Industrial Revolution, was excessive,
但是却没市场上却没有足够的资金
but there wasn't enough capital in the market
去购买这些商品
to purchase these goods.
所以经济就很很差
So the economy was very bad.
那美国在这两次战争
During these two wars,
他并没有参与在他的这个本土
the U.S. wasn't involved on its own soil.
对全部这些战争都是在
Yes, all these wars happened
不是在美国本土发生的
outside of U.S. territory.
所以他们的购买力就非常的强
So their purchasing power was very strong.
所以等于是美国
So, in essence, the U.S.
美国基本上是靠著
basically relied on
第一次跟第二次世界大战起来的
rose to power through the First and Second World Wars.
因为在第二次世界大战之前
Because before the Second World War,
其实美国的这个GDP呢
the GDP of the United States
也就是全球的第十几名了
was only around the tenth or so globally.
就是非常非常中端的一个国家
It was a very mid-tier country.
但是第二次世界大战之后
But after the Second World War,
就正式起飞
it officially took off.
然后现在也是
And now, of course,
就当然是全世界最强的国家
it's the strongest country in the world.
然后包含军力包含经济都是
Both in terms of military and economy.
那我刚刚聊到这个美国政策的问题
Now, getting back to the issue of U.S. policies,
就是美国疯狂印钱
the U.S. is printing money like crazy.
想要不要发生经济海啸
They’re trying to avoid an economic tsunami.
或金融海啸经济危机这些状况
Or financial crises and economic downturns.
你觉得会不会跟民主制度有关系
Do you think this is related to the democratic system?
就我觉得跟美国四年一选的总统
I think it’s tied to the U.S. presidential election every four years.
是有关系
It’s connected.
因为没有人想当那个爆掉的总统
Because no one wants to be the president when things collapse.
就我相信绝对是有关系
I’m certain it’s related.
因为你毕竟你要
Because, after all, you have to
你的政策推行的时候
face a lot of criticism
你会遭受到很多质疑的声浪
when you push forward your policies.
那大部分的老百姓
Most ordinary people
你很难去跟他解释说
are hard to explain to.
你国家现在正在面临什么样的问题
It’s tough to tell them what problems the country is facing
跟你要做什么样的事
and what needs to be done.
要去拯救这个金融的状况
To save the financial situation.
比如说你现在是一个重度的
For example, if you’re now in a severe
像你刚才打了比方
situation, like you mentioned earlier,
你是一个重度的那个毒瘾患者
you’re like a severe drug addict.
你不能说你但你这个事情
You can’t just say, but this issue—
你并不能跟你的的人民讲说
you can’t tell your people
我们现在国家就是染上毒瘾了
that the country is addicted to drugs right now.
那我现在要打针了
And now I need to inject.
我现在我必须要打药了
I have to take the drug now.
我才能那个
Only then can I—
但是他就要做出很多
But they have to take many
看起来很crazy的手段
seemingly crazy measures.
但是我觉得这幕后的这个团队
But I think the team behind the scenes
虽然我们的总统川普
even though our President Trump
看起来好像很疯狂
seems quite crazy,
好像做事很不理智
seems to act irrationally,
但是我觉得他背后的团队
I think his team behind him
是这一切都是很有章法的
has a very methodical approach to everything.
在去操作
They’re managing it.
说到这个我觉得太有感受了
Speaking of this, I feel so strongly about it.
因为这个跟过去四年简直是
Because this is completely different
完全不同的东西
from the past four years.
过去四年我根本有看不到
In the past four years, I couldn’t see
拜登团队他们有做任何的事情
the Biden team doing anything at all.
对因为你可以看得出来
Right, because you can tell
他这个关税战大家一打的时候
when this tariff war started,
大家就觉得说怎么会这么crazy
everyone thought, how could it be so crazy?
怎么会这样子
How could this happen?
那这个通膨是不是要爆掉了啦
Isn’t this inflation going to explode?
那这个人民要受苦啦什么的
Won’t the people suffer because of this?
但是很明显看得出来
But it’s very obvious to see
你这个通膨它只是
that this inflation is just
这个关税战啊它只是一个
This tariff war is just a
你谈判的筹码
bargaining chip in negotiations.
今天你必须要把这个东西丢出来
You have to throw this out there
各国才会愿意跟你谈
for other countries to be willing to talk.
那事实也证明
And the facts prove it.
你看不管是欧盟也好
Whether it's the EU,
日本也好台湾也好
Japan, or Taiwan,
那美国对于他们都签到了
the U.S. has signed deals with them
相当就是有优势的deal
that are quite advantageous,
对美国非常有利的一个deal
very beneficial to the U.S.
没错没错那这个这个道理
Exactly, and this principle
其实跟我们经营公司是一样的
is actually the same as running a company.
就是你不管在任何时候
No matter the situation,
你必须要对做你国家最有效益的事情
you must do what’s most beneficial for your country,
对你公司最有效益的事情
or for your company.
你这个国家才有办法壮大
Only then can your country grow stronger.
那当然这中间是很nasty
Of course, the process can be nasty,
很很ugly但是
very ugly, but
那说到这个东西
speaking of this,
我就想要跟大家聊一件事
I want to discuss something with everyone.
因为我们大部分的观众
Since most of our audience
都是来自于亚洲嘛
comes from Asia,
那其中有一半是来自台湾的
with half of them from Taiwan,
那对于当时美国提出关税这件事情
when the U.S. proposed tariffs back then,
很多人很反抗
many people were resistant.
很多人觉得说哇
Many felt, wow,
他们怎么可以这样子
how could they do this?
那我们就拿这个我做的行业好了
Let’s take the industry I’m in as an example,
就讲车的行业好了
the automotive industry.
所有的车子进口到美国
All cars imported to the U.S.
就以前啦进口到美国
in the past, when imported to the U.S.,
是不用付关税的
didn’t have to pay tariffs.
因为美国对车是非常非常友好的
Because the U.S. was very friendly to cars,
不管是欧洲来的车啊
whether they came from Europe
对汽车大国嘛
or other major car-producing countries.
就美国的这个从美国以外
Cars imported to the U.S. from outside
进口来美国的车子是不用付关税的
didn’t have to pay tariffs.
那很简单一个道理
It’s a simple concept.
就是大家在看我的频道
For everyone watching my channel,
不管你是在台湾或者是在亚洲
whether you’re in Taiwan or elsewhere in Asia,
的各大地区
in various regions,
我们就拿台湾做个例子好了
let’s use Taiwan as an example.
今天一样的车子
For the same car,
我们就说一台BMW M3好了
let’s say a BMW M3,
在美国可能是卖7到8万的美金
it might cost 70 to 80 thousand USD in the U.S.,
然后进到台湾的时候
but when it’s imported to Taiwan,
台湾人要购买这个车
Taiwanese buyers purchasing this car
一样的车子却要付双倍的钱
have to pay double the price for the same car,
有的时候甚至要达到三倍
sometimes even up to triple,
看排气量
depending on the engine size.
那这中间呢就是因为台湾
The reason for this is because Taiwan
收了很大的关税
imposes high tariffs,
然后上面又收了排气税
plus an engine displacement tax,
然后又收奢侈税
and then a luxury tax.
这些东西呢全部钱都进到
All these costs go straight
政府的口袋
into the government’s pocket.
对没错
Exactly.
然后消费者就是在买单的那个人
And the consumer is the one footing the bill.
所以大家不要觉得很奇怪
So don't find it strange
觉得美国为什么要收关税
why the U.S. imposes tariffs.
因为这个才是很正常的事情
Because this is actually normal.
在越南在一些亚洲其他国家
In Vietnam and other Asian countries,
收的关税甚至是比台湾还要更高的
tariffs are even higher than in Taiwan.
所以我就觉得这个民主制度
So I think this democratic system—
我也不知道该怎么解决这件事情啊
I don’t know how to solve this issue.
因为前几天我们有聊过嘛
We talked about it a few days ago, right?
就是今天投票
About voting today.
那投票今天大家都是一票
Today, everyone gets one vote.
是的是的是的
Yes, yes, yes.
那今天这个民主的制度
But is this democratic system
真的是公平的吗
really fair?
真的是对这个国家来讲
Is it truly, for a country,
是一定是百分之百的是好事吗
100% a good thing?
我觉得也不见得
I don’t think so.
因为今天一个
Because today, as you said,
就像你那天讲的你说一个博士
a PhD holder,
或者是一个政治的博士
or a political PhD,
就是对各方面或者是金融的博士
or someone with a PhD in finance,
对各方面都非常非常了解的人
who understands everything very well,
他也是一票
gets one vote.
然后一个每天吃喝拉撒
And someone who does nothing all day,
完全不工作的人
doesn’t work at all,
也是一票
also gets one vote.
是的
Yes.
那这样的一个制度真的是完美的吗
Is such a system really perfect?
或者真的是对一个国家的发展
Or is it really good
来讲是好的吗
for a country’s development?
我觉得这个其实要打上很大的一个问号
I think this raises a big question mark.
那我觉得美国说了这么多
After saying so much about the U.S.,
虽然说民主的体系
although the democratic system
它一定会有优缺点
definitely has pros and cons,
那包含了独裁体系
as does a dictatorship,
它一定会有优缺点
it also has pros and cons.
但是不可否认是
But undeniably,
我觉得美国社会给我们的东西
I think American society offers us
是给所有想要努力的人
opportunities for everyone who works hard.
都有一个机会
Yes, an opportunity.
对有一个机会是
Exactly, an opportunity.
所以这点我相信Alex在美国创业
So I believe Alex, starting a business in the U.S.,
然后现在也对非常非常有感
must feel this very deeply now.
然后我也是在美国创业的
I also started my business in the U.S.,
然后我也是靠著自己白手起家
and I built everything from scratch.
然后从什么都没有最低工资
From nothing, from minimum wage,
走到今天这样子
to where I am today.
所以我觉得美国这个社会
So I think American society
还是会给想努力的人
still gives so many opportunities
非常非常多的机会
to those who strive.
因为这件事在台湾你能发生的机会
Because the chance of this happening in Taiwan
就是微乎其微几乎
is extremely slim, almost nonexistent.
对几乎我常常开玩笑说
Yes, almost. I often joke that
你的best chance大概就是
your best chance is probably
去卖盐酥鸡
to sell fried chicken snacks.
这听起来很沮丧
It sounds discouraging,
对因为你因为基本上
because, basically,
你台湾的这整个结构已经很固化
Taiwan’s entire structure is very rigid.
因为你的你在台湾工作
Because when you work in Taiwan,
你第一个要面临的问题
The first problem you face
就是你的低薪环境
is the low-wage environment.
就是哪怕你今天到
Even if you manage to
你的月薪已经到六七万了
earn a monthly salary of 60,000 to 70,000,
其实还是很低
it’s still quite low.
对但是在台湾已经算不错了
Yeah, but in Taiwan, that’s considered decent.
但是你以台湾的房价物价
However, with Taiwan’s housing and living costs,
其实我们回台湾都知道
we all know when we go back to Taiwan,
就是你你去消费
that when you spend money,
不会比较便宜
it’s not cheaper.
并没有比LA便宜
It’s not cheaper than in LA.
你包括吃那份量还小
Even the portion sizes are smaller.
我觉得吃是要看等级啦
I think it depends on the level of dining.
就是假如说我们今天吃卤肉饭
For example, if we’re eating braised pork rice,
什么当然是非常便宜
of course, it’s very cheap.
但是如果今天你要吃好的食物
But if you want to eat high-quality food,
跟美国基本上有过之而无不及
it’s comparable to or even more expensive than in the US.
对
Yeah.
因为你你说的那些是street food
Because what you’re talking about is street food.
嘛
Right.
就是你那些小吃店啊
Like those small eateries
或者是夜市啊这种
or night market stalls.
那当然是很便宜
Of course, those are very cheap.
但如果说以上餐馆
But if we’re talking about dining at restaurants,
就是上馆子这样子话
like going to proper establishments,
我觉得消费其实几乎没有区别
I think the cost is almost the same.
我觉得没有区别
I don’t think there’s a difference.
然后房价也比美国贵很多
And housing prices are much higher than in the US.
就普遍台北市的房价
Generally, in Taipei City,
是非常非常贵的
housing is extremely expensive.
然后就各方面的开销啦
And all kinds of expenses
没有比较低
aren’t any lower.
但是薪水却非常非常低
But salaries are extremely low.
对这是一个还处于一个
Yeah, it’s still at a stage
低价劳工的这个阶段这样子
of cheap labor.
说到这个我想跟你分享一件事情
Speaking of this, I want to share something.
就是我妈以前是在远东航空
My mom used to work at Far Eastern Air Transport
做总经理的秘书
as the general manager’s secretary.
然后这个是大概
This was about
他退休应该已经20几年了
20-something years ago when she retired.
然后当时他退休的时候
And at the time of her retirement,
就20几年2000年初的时候
back in the early 2000s,
他做一个秘书的薪水
her salary as a secretary
将近8万台币
was nearly 80,000 NTD.
OK现在一模一样的工作
OK, now for the exact same job,
大概3万多
it’s about 30,000-something.
还还倒退了
It’s actually gone backward.
所以这件事情你不觉得就是很
So don’t you think this is just
就是这中间一定出现了很大的问题
a sign that something major has gone wrong?
因为职位是一样的
Because the position is the same.
然后20年前的钱又比现在的
And 20 years ago, money was worth
之前这么多
so much more than now.
我觉得20年前的8万
I think 80,000 back then
可能是现在maybe 20万都有可能
might be worth 200,000 today, possibly.
Yeah
Yeah.
然后现在一样的工作
And now, for the same job,
却只付3万多的薪水
they only pay a little over 30,000.
对我觉得最重要还是
Yeah, I think the most important thing is still
钱都跑到前端人的口袋里面
The money all ends up in the pockets of those at the top.
因为现在刚刚讲到这个金融体系吧
Because, as we just mentioned, the financial system...
就是因为现在美国的做法
is influenced by the practices in the U.S.
就是我不断的印钱
They keep printing money.
但这些钱最后到哪去了
But where does this money end up?
真的有回到我们所谓的中产
Does it really go back to the so-called middle class
或者是普罗大众这种
or the general public?
低阶层的这个消费族群吗
To the lower-tier consumer groups?
其实并没有
Not really.
那这些钱其实是到了资本家手上
In fact, this money goes to the capitalists.
那因为只有资本家他才有能力
Because only capitalists have the ability
再拿了这些钱去抄底更多的
to take this money and buy up more assets
国外的资产去海外的资产
like foreign or overseas properties.
那这样子的情况之下
Under these circumstances,
美国的金融体系才可以一直维持
the U.S. financial system can maintain
在一个就是全球顶端的这个位置
its position at the top globally.
就讲难听点就美国政府
To put it bluntly, the U.S. government
华尔街在干的事情
and Wall Street are doing
就是割全球的韭菜啊
what amounts to exploiting the world.
对没错他今天要引爆这个关税战
Exactly, today they might trigger a tariff war.
他的目的就是说
Their goal is to say,
因为美国已经遇到金融危机了
since the U.S. is already facing a financial crisis,
其实金融危机已经发生了
a financial crisis has already happened.
但是民众并没有感受到
But the public hasn’t felt it yet
因为政府在操盘
because the government is manipulating things.
那要怎么样把美国这个金融危机
So how do they pull the U.S. out of this crisis?
把美国从金融危机里面拯救出来
How do they save the U.S. from financial collapse?
就是我今天把全世界都拉
By dragging the whole world into it.
都拉成金融危机
Dragging everyone down.
我把全世界都拉下水
Pulling the whole world underwater.
那我就可以在这个
Then, in this scenario,
大家都在金融危机的状况下
when everyone is in a financial crisis,
脱颖而出
they can stand out.
因为美国是最有能力
Because the U.S. has the most capability
从金融危机上做出恢复的
to recover from a financial crisis.
因为包括他的美债
Because of their treasury bonds,
包括他的黄金他的美金他的石油
their gold, their dollar, their oil.
他就拥有全世界最强的资源
They hold the world’s strongest resources.
对所以他是最可以在
Yes, so they are the most able
就是每一个国家都在货币贬值
to thrive when every country’s currency is devaluing.
的情况之下
In that situation,
他是最可以让美金重新
they are the most capable of making the dollar
脱颖而出
stand out again.
说到这个就是美金强的这件事情
Speaking of the dollar’s strength,
这个我有些观众
some of my viewers
他们持有一些比较不一样的看法
have different opinions on this.
他们会觉得说某一天
They think that one day,
他们希望这个美金的体系可以崩塌
they hope the dollar system will collapse.
可以怎么样就是他们不希望
They don’t want
这个美金主导全世界经济的
the dollar to dominate the global economy
这个游戏会持续下去
and for this game to continue.
但是那天我跟你也有聊过嘛
But we’ve talked about this before,
就是今天如果真的来那天的话
if that day really comes,
对我们来讲绝对绝对不会是好事
it definitely won’t be a good thing for us.
因为美国就会想办法打仗
Because the U.S. will find a way to start a war.
对没错因为美国其实
Exactly, because the U.S., in fact,
以最原始的贸易来看呢
looking at the most basic level of trade,
就是你每一个国家supposedly
every country is supposedly
都要有进口跟出口
Every country needs imports and exports.
因为以我们回到一个
Because if we go back to
就是以物易物的这个
the concept of bartering,
最古老的这交易模式嘛
the oldest form of trade, right?
对不对你需要
Isn't that so? You need
那货币只是它中间流通的一个工具
currency just as a medium of exchange.
就是我今天要跟你换东西
So, if I want to trade with you today,
那换东西太不方便了
direct bartering is too inconvenient.
所以我们就用货币来解决这个问题
So we use currency to solve this problem.
这也是最早为什么黄金
This is also why gold
它是一个通用资产嘛
was originally a universal asset.
那之后变美金跟黄金挂钩
Later, the US dollar was pegged to gold.
那就美金变成全球的这个通用资产
So the dollar became the global universal asset.
那之后1967年的时候
Then, in 1967,
美金就跟黄金1971的时候
and by 1971, the US dollar
美金跟黄金脱钩了
was decoupled from gold.
那他就可以开始印钞
Then they could start printing money,
玩他的印钞游戏了
playing their money-printing game.
那这个美国的出口是什么
So, what is America’s export?
美国出口除了高科技产品
Besides high-tech products,
接下来就是军火
it’s weapons.
那所以这个也是军火商一直在美国
That’s why arms dealers in the US
就是扮演一个很大资本家的角色
play a huge role as major capitalists.
所以真的在美国经济
So, when the US economy
他复合不了的时候
can’t sustain itself,
他必须要有一个宣泄的管道
it needs an outlet.
他必须要有一个就是出口
It needs a way to export.
他必须要让这个东西出口
It must export these things
他才可以获取到更多的资金嘛
to acquire more funds, right?
那唯一的方法就是打仗
The only way is through war.
对这个我跟Alex是非常非常同意的
Yes, Alex and I strongly agree on this.
但我知道在这边听可能很多人
But I know many listeners here
会觉得说我们在阴谋论或什么的
might think we’re into conspiracy theories.
但是我觉得这个就是认知的不同啦
But I think it’s just a difference in perspective.
那我今天这是我们看到的东西
This is what we see today.
大家如果看得懂那就看得懂
If you get it, great.
如果看不懂的话也没什么关系
If not, no worries.
因为事实上打仗跟我们以前的打仗
Because, in reality, war today
他现在已经不需要
isn't like wars of the past.
不需要就是说我今天要杀得你死我活
It doesn’t mean fighting to the death.
才叫打仗
That’s not war anymore.
他打仗有非常多种形式
War takes many forms.
包括现在的这个贸易战
Including the current trade war.
那贸易战为什么叫贸易战
Why is it called a trade war?
这也算是一种打仗
It’s also a form of war.
对那包括这个对不对乌俄战争
Right, like the Ukraine-Russia conflict,
对不对然后包括这个
and also, you know,
他对中东国家这些一些政治的制裁
political sanctions on Middle Eastern countries.
都算是一种战争手段
These are all forms of warfare.
侵略式的手段
Aggressive tactics.
所以其实在过去20年里面
So, in the past 20 years,
这个世界就是不停的在打仗
the world has been constantly at war.
那背后其实我觉得都是美国
And I think behind it all is the US,
在操控这些事情啦
manipulating these events.
是是是为了从这些东西得到利益
Yes, yes, to profit from these things.
OK那我们进到下一个环节
OK, let’s move to the next segment.
就是在我们节目当中
In our program,
我们都会聊college is a
we always discuss college is a
scam
scam
就是大学可能是一个诈骗的这件事情
That is, college might be a scam.
那我不知道Alex你有你有读大学吗
I don't know, Alex, did you go to college?
有有有你有毕业吗
Yes, yes, did you graduate?
有有毕业我还蛮努力念大学的
Yes, I graduated. I worked pretty hard in college.
当时是读什么学校
Which school did you attend?
我念的是那个CW
I went to CW.
就是Central Washington University
That's Central Washington University.
在靠近西雅图那边
It's near Seattle,
旁边的一个小城市这样子
in a small city nearby.
那我大概分享一下这个东西是什么意思
Let me briefly explain what this means.
就是说college scam
So, college scam,
当然不是在说
of course, doesn't refer to
就是医生啊律师啊或者这些专业的
doctors, lawyers, or other professional fields.
对专业是一定需要读书的嘛
Those professions definitely require education.
但是百分之超过80%以上的科目
But for over 80% of majors,
基本上毕业之后
after graduation,
这些人真正在工作
the actual work these people do
跟他们读的东西有关的这个比例
is related to their studies in less than 20% of cases.
就不到20%
Exactly, less than 20%.
对没错
Right, exactly.
就是大部分人他们都是在做一些
Most people end up doing something
不是他们读的不是他们本业的东西
unrelated to what they studied.
那如果要做不是本业的事情
If you're going to do something unrelated,
为什么要在读完四年college
why spend four years in college,
然后背了一个可能10万到20万美金
and then come out with $100,000 to $200,000
的这个学贷之后再出来做
in student loans before starting work?
我不知道Alex怎么想
I don't know what Alex thinks.
就是今天你出来创业
You've started your own business
也在做生意做了十几年了
and have been in business for over a decade.
你觉得现今2025年学历
Do you think in 2025, a degree
对于大部分的职业来讲
is still important for most careers?
还是很重要吗
Is it still crucial?
就像我说的这个其实社会
As I mentioned, society
对每一个人都有他一相对程度的
has a certain level of expectation
这个expectation
for everyone.
那今天你要你要学历
If you want a degree,
它是一个基本门槛
it's a basic threshold.
就是你今天你想要做一件事情
If you want to do something,
你必须除非你是富二代
unless you're a second-generation rich kid,
除非你有第一桶金
unless you have startup capital,
otherwise
otherwise,
most of people
most people
他需要先去有先去get a job
need to first get a job.
他先去有一个第一份工作
They need to land their first job.
那你要怎么样得到这个第一份工作
And how do you get that first job?
最直观的就是你的履历表
The most straightforward way is through your resume.
所以我觉得学历这个东西
So, I think a degree,
当然不是学历越高越好
of course, doesn't mean the higher, the better,
但是我觉得它是一个基本门槛
but I think it's a basic requirement.
你需要去完成它
You need to complete it.
它是一个过程
It's a process.
它是一个人生的过程
It's a life process.
对就是虽然我们现在可以
Yes, even though nowadays we can
透过很多东西来学习
learn through many resources,
包括是网路上也好
whether it's online
或者是AI也好
or through AI,
那我们就可以学习到非常多的东西
we can learn a tremendous amount.
在学校学不到的
Things you can't learn in school.
那但是你没有学历
But without a degree,
你可能连丢履历表的机会都没有
you might not even get a chance to submit a resume.
那你怎么样去获得这个第一份工作呢
So how do you get that first job?
我想分享的东西是我认识
I want to share that among the people I know,
不管是我客人也好
whether they’re my clients
或是身边的人也好
or people around me,
其实我非常非常多的创业家
a huge number of entrepreneurs,
包含你也是
including you,
那其实我在我的经验
based on my experience,
我觉得我碰到的创业家里面
I think among the entrepreneurs I’ve met,
可能大概七成以上是
probably over 70% of them
没有大学学历的
don’t have a college degree.
然后我的想法是这样
And my thought is this:
我觉得大学学历
I think a college degree,
就是你在上大学这个过程当中
during the process of attending university,
你会变相的被这个教育体制给洗脑
you indirectly get brainwashed by the education system.
对没错
Exactly.
就你会失去一些这个自我思考能力
You lose some of your critical thinking skills,
你会失去一些创新的能力
and you lose some of your ability to innovate.
那这个也是我跟不同的创业家
This is also a conclusion I’ve reached
聊出来的一个结果
after talking with different entrepreneurs.
就觉得说学校体系呢
It feels like the school system
就是被设计出来
is designed
训练员工阶层的一个
to train people for employee roles.
对没错
Exactly.
一个体制吧
It’s a system.
没错没错因为就像我说的
Right, right, because as I said,
他这个社会在套路你嘛
society is setting you up.
因为你必须要有这么多的劳动力
Because there needs to be so much labor,
你必须要有这么多的
there needs to be so many
就是打工阶层
working-class people
你才能去支撑这个社会
to support society.
它基本的一个型态
It’s the basic structure.
如果说你今天
If everyone today
每个人都想要当10%
wants to be in the top 10%,
或甚至1%
or even the top 1%,
那谁来当剩下的99%
then who will make up the remaining 99%?
对不对所以他整个体系
Right? So the whole system,
他的社会制度就是设计
the social structure is designed
要有这么多的劳动力
to have this many laborers,
他要有这么多的劳动阶层
this many working-class people.
那至于念大学有没有用
As for whether college is useful,
对我本身来讲我运气比较好
for me personally, I was luckier.
因为我本身的科目
Because my major
就是念
was
这个supply chain management
supply chain management.
喔哇所以你真的是有做到跟
Oh, wow, so you actually ended up
对我刚好是做到有跟物流相关
working in something related to logistics.
就是也是误打误撞
Yeah, it was by chance.
我在念的时候我根本不知道
When I was studying, I had no idea
这是什么东西
what it was.
对但是
Right, but
对于大部分人来讲
for most people,
我也认同你说的
I agree with what you said.
就是其实大学并没办法
College doesn’t really
对你实操有什么帮助
help with practical skills.
就哪怕你今天读的这个是你的本科
Even if what you studied is your field.
但你出去做生意之后
But after you start a business,
对就是完全
Right, it's completely
对我是完全
Right, for me it's totally
totally different
totally different
concept
concept
那就我们基本上都是在重新学过
So basically, we're relearning everything
但是
But
它对你一些business的
It does help with some business
就是一些书信啊
like writing letters
或者是一些business
or some business
一些solution啊
solutions
它它是有给到就是一个
It does provide a
很好的concept
solid concept
就是大学我大学念的东西
The things I learned in university
我基本上都还记得
I basically still remember
就是对我来讲其实是影响蛮深远
For me, it had a pretty deep impact
所以我不会
So I wouldn't
我不是那种读书无效论
I'm not someone who thinks education is useless
但是我也不会认为说
But I also don't believe
你今天一定要念到就是
that you must study to
就是万般皆下品
think everything else is inferior
就唯有读书高这样子的一个
and only studying is superior
这一个传统的这个观念
That kind of traditional mindset
因为
Because
其实创业这条路
the path of entrepreneurship
我也不是建议每个人都走
I don't recommend it for everyone
因为你今天创业成功率
Because the success rate of starting a business
大概只有5%
is only about 5%
对也是非常非常低啦
Right, it's extremely low
对5%的情况之下
Right, with a 5% chance
是你第一年
in the first year
但你到了第五年以后
But by the fifth year
你这其中留下来的企业
of the businesses that survive
大概只剩下5%
only about 5% remain
所以事实上你这个成功机率
So in reality, your success rate
是不到1%啊
is less than 1%
那如果今天你用
Now, if you compare it
跳伞来比方
to skydiving
如果你今天告诉你跳伞
If someone told you skydiving
有99%会死掉
has a 99% chance of death
会死亡你还会去跳吗
would you still jump?
你不会去跳
You wouldn't jump
那为什么这些人还要
So why do these people
就是这么无脑的去创业
still blindly start businesses?
不是因为他们想创业
It's not because they want to
当然这其中可能有他们想创业
Of course, some might want to
但是我觉得
But I think
大部分人是因为生活所逼
most people are forced by circumstances
就是他再也他没办法
They have no other choice
他必须得去创业
They must start a business
对我我觉得很重要的一个重点是
Right, I think a very important point is
大家必须知道自己的优势在哪里
everyone must know their strengths
是是是
Yes, yes, yes
你在创业你在做这个行业的时候
When you start a business in an industry
你必须很了解这个行业
you must understand that industry
今天不是说我从来都没有
It's not like I've never
做过一颗小笼包
made a single dumpling
然后我就可以去开一家
and then I can open a shop
小笼包的餐厅
a Xiao Long Bao restaurant
对对对
Exactly
所以你今天你要成为
So, if you want to become
这个行业当中的佼佼者
a leader in this industry,
你才有可能在
only then can you
商业世界当中脱颖而出
stand out in the business world.
因为这就是一个很残酷
Because it’s a very harsh
一个互相竞争的一个市场
and competitive market.
所以今天如果你连自己的优势
So, if you don’t even know
是什么都不知道
what your strengths are,
你连你自己的行业
or if you don’t understand
都没有这么了解的话
your own industry well,
那基本上不要说99%
then basically, forget 99%,
我觉得100%都会失败的
I think 100% you’ll fail.
对没错因为我一直认为
Right, exactly, because I’ve always believed
人生的这个这个
that life, this thing,
我对人生的定义啊
my definition of life is
人生是一场就是
that life is a process
跟自己对话的过程
of having a dialogue with yourself.
那其实
And actually,
我们都我们穷尽一生
we spend our whole lives
可能都在了解
trying to understand
试图了解社会
and figure out society,
试图了解经济
trying to understand the economy,
或试图了解其他人
or trying to understand others.
但其实我们真正需要做的
But what we really need to do
是是了解自己
is understand ourselves.
所以这个假如说在
So, if we’re talking about,
OK我们就说2025年
okay, let’s say the year 2025,
这个资讯爆棚的年代
an era of information overload,
这个对于现在年轻人
for young people today,
因为我的观众很多是
because many of my viewers
大概25到30岁的这个区间
are in the 25 to 30 age range,
就非常迷惘的年纪
a very confusing age.
对对对对因为我曾经我也是这个年纪
Right, exactly, because I was once that age,
我也是很迷惘
I was also very lost.
那如果今天要Alex给自己一个建议
So, if today Alex were to give advice to himself,
就今天假如说你看到自己
if you saw yourself
20出头的样子
in your early 20s,
然后你会
what would you
给怎么样的一个建议
advise yourself?
就不要后悔
Don’t regret.
就是你今天做任何决定
Whatever decision you make today,
你都要相信
you have to believe in it,
因为你人生只有一次
because you only have one life.
那你做任何决定
So, any decision you make,
你都不应该去后悔
you shouldn’t regret it.
哇nice这跟我真的是一模一样
Wow, nice, that’s exactly the same as me.
对就是因为你必须要
Right, because you have to
对你自己做的决定去负责
take responsibility for your decisions.
那obviously我们没办法
Obviously, we can’t
像打游戏一样就可以死掉再重来
just die and restart like in a game.
复活
Respawn.
对复活我们没有复活的机会
Right, respawn, we don’t get a second chance.
所以你只有一次的时候
So, when you only have one shot,
你就是做好你觉得对的事情
just do what you think is right,
然后撇除杂音
and ignore the noise.
然后就是
And that’s it.
坚持到底
Stick to it.
OK
OK.
然后
And then,
我佩服Alex不只是
I admire Alex not just because
他是一个很成功的创业家
he’s a very successful entrepreneur,
然后他非常非常低调
but also because he’s incredibly low-key.
因为我很喜欢那种就是
I really like people who
很懂很多然后会做事
know a lot and get things done,
但是不多说的人
but don’t talk much about it.
对
Right.
就是所谓
In other words,
因为我见过很多那种
I’ve met a lot of people who
雷声大雨点小的这种人
talk big but deliver little.
就是在外面就是
They’re out there just
侃侃而谈
boasting,
然后谈他怎么投资
talking about their investments,
谈他怎么做事情
bragging about what they do,
但背后其实没有东西的
but there’s nothing substantial behind it.
所以我非常非常
So, I really,
就我很喜欢啦
I really appreciate that.
就是很低调的人
I like people who are low-key,
然后但是背后却懂很多的人
but behind the scenes, know so much.
那不只我喜欢Alex不只是这点
And it’s not just this that I admire about Alex,
其中另一点非常非常让我佩服的是
another thing that really impresses me is
他对他老婆的一个
his attitude of respect
尊敬的respect的态度
toward his wife.
所以你对Cathy是
So, you are very,
非常非常respectful
very respectful to Cathy.
那这件事情呢
And this is something
其实在很多
that, honestly, in many
大部分成功的男生身上
successful men,
是找不到的
you don’t often see.
就是很多成功的男人
A lot of successful men,
他们可能会因为
perhaps because of
可能是因为老婆支持或怎么样
their wife’s support or whatever,
或者是他们今天
or maybe because today
原本不是很有钱
they weren’t wealthy before,
然后突然变得很有钱了
and then suddenly became rich,
然后他们就开始对老婆大小声
they start yelling at their wives,
对
Right.
然后去外面找小三
and then go out looking for mistresses,
然后不顾
and disregard
不顾小孩
their children.
这这种人我觉得我见过太多了
I’ve seen way too many people like this.
对
Right.
然后这样的人
And people like that,
就哪怕他们一年赚个
even if they make
五六千万美金
50 or 60 million dollars a year,
我也看不起他们
I still don’t respect them.
我也不觉得他们是怎么样的人
I don’t think much of them.
对我们我其实也有认识
Right, I’ve also known
就是这种这种这种圈子
people in this kind of circle.
对所以所以我对这个上面
Right, so on this matter,
我非常非常佩服你
I really, really admire you.
因为
Because
因为Cathy她是一个比较
Cathy, she’s kind of a
怎么讲比较polarizing的一个人吧
how should I say, polarizing person, right?
就她非常在外面很会social
She’s very social and outgoing.
然后
And
有很多自己的想法
she has a lot of her own ideas.
那Alex身为一个创业家
As an entrepreneur, Alex,
他一定也会有自己的想法
you must have your own ideas too.
对
Right.
所以你们相处上你是
So, how do you two get along?
你们相处的方式是怎么样
What’s your way of interacting?
的一个方式我很好奇
I’m really curious about it.
就是你会让著她吗
Do you let her have her way?
还是这是一个互相的关系
Or is it a mutual relationship?
就有一个互我们我们个性
Do your personalities balance each other?
其实算是蛮截长补短的
Our personalities actually complement each other quite well.
因为对蛮互补对
Yes, we’re pretty complementary.
就包括个性上
Both in personality
或者是处事上
and in how we handle things.
这样就是蛮互补的
So, we complement each other a lot.
那
Well,
他就是他是一个
she is someone who—
他不是
she isn’t—
我这样讲好像不是很好
I might not be phrasing this well,
但他不是一个很聪明的人
but she’s not necessarily very smart,
但是他是一个很有智慧的女生这样子
but she’s a very wise woman.
OK我觉得女生有智慧非常重要
OK, I think wisdom in women is crucial.
对有智慧非常重要对
Yes, wisdom is very important.
那他他觉得我懂的
She thinks I know
就是专业知识
the professional knowledge.
那他他的部分就是
And her part is
他很会跟人去
she’s great at connecting
人与人的交流
with people.
对人与人的交流对
Yes, interacting with people.
对所以我们刚好就是
So, we happen to
在这方面挺互补
complement each other in this way.
那我是比较抓大方向
I focus on the big picture
在公司的经营上面
in running the company.
那他他的话就是
And she handles
他的管理啊他的就是
management and
一些公司的这个
some of the company’s
细节他可以弄得非常的好
details extremely well.
我觉得这超级超级难得
I think that’s incredibly rare.
对因为你看我们公司
Yes, because look at our company—
我们是应该是
we’re probably
物流公司里面是最漂亮的
the most beautiful logistics company.
就是在
I mean,
不一定没有到碧丽堂皇
not necessarily luxurious,
但是绝对是干干净净整整齐齐
but definitely clean and tidy.
我觉得能跟另一半工作
I think working with your partner
是一个非常难得的事情
is a very rare thing.
因为我跟我太太就不可能一起工作
Because my wife and I could never work together.
对我觉得我觉得基本上是没有
Yeah, I think it’s basically impossible.
真的非常非常困难
It’s really, really hard.
就是很少很少
It’s very rare.
因为我们我们是一天24小时
Because we’re together 24 hours a day,
365天都在一起
365 days a year.
基本上都在一起
Basically always together.
基本上都
Pretty much.
然后你们会常常吵架吗
Do you often argue?
还是也不会还好
Or is it not too bad?
口角一定会有
Small disagreements are inevitable.
但是吵架倒还好
But actual arguments, not really.
对吵架倒还好
Yeah, arguments aren't too bad.
对我觉得啦就是所有真正屌的人
I think truly impressive people,
让我就是敬佩的男人
the men I really admire,
就是可以把老婆照顾好的人
are those who take good care of their wives.
就是让老婆非常非常开心的人
They make their wives incredibly happy.
就有很多很多我遇到
I've met many people
做生意赚很多钱的人
who make a lot of money in business,
都是在外面有小三
but have mistresses on the side.
然后对老婆就是
And to their wives, they act
好像是一个陌生人一样
like complete strangers.
就这种就是
This kind of behavior,
我非常非常看不起这种人
I absolutely despise it.
就包含了带小孩也是
This includes raising kids too.
小孩全部都交给阿姨带
They leave the kids entirely to nannies,
然后自己不愿意花时间在小孩身上
unwilling to spend time with their own children.
其实很多时候你就是
A lot of times, if you just
换位思考一下
put yourself in their shoes,
就可以理解对方的感受嘛
you can understand how the other person feels.
因为他女生真的是蛮不容易
Because being a woman is really not easy.
因为你有老婆有小孩你就知道
If you have a wife and kids, you’d know.
就是不管是怀孕的过程
Whether it’s the process of pregnancy
那生产的过程
or giving birth,
那我老婆是陪我一路走过来
my wife has been with me through it all.
就是非常的辛苦
It’s been incredibly tough.
包括他那时候怀我大宝的时候
Including the time when he was pregnant with our first child
是怀孕五个月
She was five months pregnant
然后孕吐症状非常严重
And had severe morning sickness
然后我们是开著车去德州开战
Then we drove to Texas for a battle
那时候开了
Back then, we drove
你也知道加州到德州是非常远
You know, California to Texas is really far
那我们曾经有100迈是没有加油站
We once drove 100 miles without a gas station
但是他却没有地方上厕所
But there was nowhere for her to use the restroom
是因为公司的关系需要走一趟
It was because of company matters that we had to make the trip
对我们在休士顿要扩一个点
It was for the company, we needed to make the trip.
对然后后来那个点没有成
We were planning to expand a location in Houston.
我们就又回来这样无功而返
But in the end, that location didn’t work out,
所以就是一路走来就很艰辛
so we came back empty-handed.
对然后包括两胎
So, the journey has been very challenging.
不管是大儿子小儿子都是
And with both pregnancies,
就是他都是在仓库里面
whether it was our eldest or youngest son,
帮忙到最后一天
she was helping in the warehouse
第二天要去生产
until the very last day.
对就是顶著大肚子
The next day, she went into labor.
然后去处理货物去做文件
Even with a big belly, she was handling goods and paperwork.
就是非常非常支持
She’s been incredibly supportive.
我觉得对就是所有在看我的观众朋友
I think, to all my viewers watching,
我都希望今天或许你还没有赚到钱
I hope that even if you haven’t made money yet,
或许你在生意上还没有成功
or succeeded in business,
但是今天如果你生意成功了
if one day you do succeed in business,
然后身边有个陪著你的女人
and you have a woman by your side,
一定要好好的对待他
you must treat her well.
要好好珍惜对
Cherish her, truly.
因为真正成功真正屌的男人
Because a truly successful and impressive man
是把自己的老婆照顾的最好的那一个人
is the one who takes the best care of his wife.
接下来我们聊一下人与人的频率好了
Next, let’s talk about human connection.
因为其实我跟Alex
Because honestly, with Alex,
这算是我们第一次很深层的一对一的聊天
this is our first deep one-on-one conversation.
对然后这件事情
Yeah, and about this matter
因为平常小孩子太多了
because usually, there are too many kids around
对这个我觉得非常非常妙
Yeah, I think this is really amazing
因为Alex其实不知道我的频道
because Alex actually didn’t know about my channel
然后是在四个月前
and it was about four months ago
四五个月前的时候
around four or five months ago
好像对可能差不多
Yeah, something like that
那时候我就邀请Cathy
At that time, I invited Cathy
因为Cathy平常对外就是
because Cathy is usually more outgoing
比较social
quite social
所以我当然是先找Cathy
So, of course, I approached Cathy first
我说Cathy
I said, Cathy
你可以来上我Podcast节目
can you come on my podcast?
想跟你聊聊天
I’d love to chat with you
然后在这一次之后
And after that time
因为我
because I
分享一些我Instagram的东西给他看
shared some of my Instagram content with her
然后Cathy就分享给Alex看
Then Cathy shared it with Alex
然后Alex就默默的竟然开始看我的频道
And Alex quietly started watching my channel
然后我每天都看
And watched it every day
我都不知道这件事情
I had no idea about this
然后直到有一天我直播
Until one day during my livestream
直播然后是讲说那个以太币的新衣服
A livestream where I talked about Ethereum’s new outfit
对然后直播过后
Yeah, and after the livestream
Alex就丢了一个Facebook的讯息
Alex sent me a Facebook message
给我说
saying
哇新衣服要出了
Wow, a new outfit is coming out
我想哇你有在看我
I was like, wow, you’re watching me
然后这件事情对我来讲其实是很震撼
And this was actually quite shocking to me
然后很rewarding
and very rewarding
因为看我的人有非常非常多
Because so many people watch me
但是其中也有很多真正很成功的企业家
and among them are many truly successful entrepreneurs
我的观众里面有一些
Some of my viewers
身家是破九位数美金的而且不少
have net worths in the nine figures in USD, and there are quite a few
每次被这些真正成功的企业家
Every time these truly successful entrepreneurs
看到我的价值的时候
recognize the value in what I do
我都觉得非常非常的开心
I feel incredibly happy
因为他们懂
Because they understand
就是我走到今天经历过的东西
the things I’ve been through to get here
或者是做频道经历过的艰辛
or the hardships I’ve faced running this channel
然后我觉得这是一个互相的一个
And I think it’s a mutual
respect
respect
所以今天创业的人
So for entrepreneurs today
都会对创业的人拥有一个respect
there’s always a respect for fellow entrepreneurs
因为我们都知道这件事情
because we all know
是非常非常不容易非常困难
this journey is incredibly hard and challenging
所以说哪怕我们可能
So even if we might
相处的时间没有这么多
not spend much time together
但我觉得哇我们竟然可以在这么快的时间里面
I’m amazed that we can connect on the same wavelength so quickly
马上进入到同样的频率
I think this is something that really comforts me
我觉得这个是让我非常非常欣慰的一件事情
I feel this is something that makes me very, very happy
对因为虽然我们没有很常跟你聊天
Yeah, because although we don’t chat with you often
但是因为我每天都有在看Derek的频道
since I watch Derek’s channel every day
从中间我觉得得到非常多的共鸣
I feel a lot of resonance from it
因为其实有
Because there are
应该说成功的人或者是
I should say, successful people or
不成功的人他们的区别
unsuccessful people, the difference
就是在于他们的思维
lies in their mindset
所有你今天所有的财富
All the wealth you have today
都应该是在你的脑子里面
should be in your mind.
就是当你打开那扇门的时候
When you open that door,
你的世界可以是无限宽广
your world can be infinitely vast.
但是如果你今天没有打开那扇门
But if you don’t open that door today,
你就是永远都在抱怨
you’ll always be complaining.
我觉得就是永远
I think it’s always about
要持有一个open mind
keeping an open mind.
没错今天你不管你在这个板块多厉害
Exactly, no matter how good you are in your field,
不管你做某些事情已经多屌了
or how amazing you are at something,
你永远要持有一个
you should always maintain
敞开的心胸然后去接受
an open heart and be ready to accept.
就每天每天都要学习
You need to learn every single day.
我每天都在学习
I learn every day.
因为像以我本身做物流来讲
For me, working in logistics,
我已经做物流做16年了
I’ve been in logistics for 16 years,
但是我觉得我还是一个小白
but I still feel like a beginner.
我每天都是抱著一个
Every day, I approach it
我还是一个小白的心态
with the mindset of a beginner.
去学习所有这个相关的知识
I keep learning all the related knowledge.
因为物流千变万化
Because logistics is constantly changing,
就是包括我相信金融也是
and I believe finance is the same.
就是每一个领域他都有他不断的
Every field has its continuous
这个世代的更新
updates with each generation.
包括这个物流的环节也是
Even in logistics,
你现在甚至中国都已经在无人机派送了
now in China, they’re already using drones for delivery.
那美国当然还是在用这个最早的卡车
While in the US, we’re still using the old trucks.
卡车但是你说这个
Trucks, but do you think
会不会有变革的一天
there will be a day of change?
我相信这一天就是不会太久
I believe that day isn’t too far off.
这个不会太久
It won’t be too long.
所以每天你都要学习新的事物
So every day, you need to learn new things
然后增加你这个行业
and increase your knowledge in this industry
或者是你增加你这个领域的专业知识
or in your field of expertise.
你才有办法一直在这个产业里面生存
Only then can you survive in this industry.
就是要知道什么时候要转型要改变
You need to know when to pivot or adapt.
因为你要知道在2020年
Because you should know, in 2020,
甚至在更之前
or even before that,
我们你在洛杉矶
if you were in Los Angeles,
是你一个plaza可能有六间快递店
a single plaza might have had six courier shops.
对你一整条有200间快递公司
Along one street, there were 200 courier companies.
现在基本上挂光了
Now, they’re basically gone.
现在基本上没有
Now, there are hardly any left.
对基本上就是十根手指头数得出来
You can count them on your fingers.
所以这个产业是非常非常竞争的
So this industry is extremely competitive.
当然它不是一个很美好的产业
Of course, it’s not a glamorous industry,
但是它是一个门槛相对比较低的产业
but it’s one with relatively low barriers to entry.
那你要在这个产业脱颖而出
To stand out in this industry,
你必须要下功夫
you must put in the effort.
OK必须要去更新
You must keep updating.
我们接下来聊聊投资吧
Let’s talk about investment next.
因为我知道Alex对于整体经济
Because I know Alex has always
就是一直都很有研究
studied the overall economy closely.
我对总体经济学我是蛮有兴趣
I’m quite interested in macroeconomics,
但我对投资我真的是不行
but I’m really not good at investing.
因为我其实比你早进市场可能几年
Because I entered the market a few years before you,
但是我投资一直都不是很好
but my investments have never been great.
然后一直到看了你频道
Then I started watching your channel.
就是因为我一直觉得持续DCA这件事情
I’ve always thought that consistently doing DCA
就是一个很入门
is something very basic,
一个很基础大家都知道
a fundamental concept everyone knows.
就是定期定额
It’s dollar-cost averaging.
但是他其实更某种深层的意义来讲
But on a deeper level, it has more meaning.
他是一个心法
It’s a mindset.
他是一个self-discipline
It’s about self-discipline.
你必须要一直不断的持续去做这件事情
You have to keep doing it consistently.
其实持续做这件事情是非常难的
Actually, sticking to it is extremely hard.
是最难的对是最难的
It’s the hardest thing, yes, the hardest.
就像大家都知道SP 500
Just like everyone knows about the S&P 500,
每年就是8到12%的收益
with its 8 to 12% annual returns,
但是问题就是大家都对
but the problem is, everyone knows,
但是你不会去做这件事情
yet you don’t actually do it.
对就是大家就会赔钱
Exactly, and then people end up losing money.
我记得前几天我们有聊到
I remember we talked a few days ago,
就是Alex有掉
and Alex mentioned,
之前你有投资Overstock的
you had invested in Overstock before.
分享这个故事给大家听
Share this story with everyone.
对我Overstock我跌了非常大一跤
Yeah, with Overstock, I took a huge fall.
那时候好像在股价19块的时候
At that time, the stock price was around $19,
我就有关注了
and I was already paying attention.
Overstock是有点像是
Overstock is kind of like,
跟物流有某种蛮大的关系
it has a pretty big connection to logistics.
我觉得它是一个网路上的一个
I thought it was an online
像是销售的平台
sales platform of sorts.
销售平台但他不务正业
A sales platform, but they went off track.
他跑去做区块链
They started getting into blockchain.
对那那时候他的股价大概在19
Yeah, back then the stock was around $19.
我记得好像17块我就已经在关注了
I remember I was watching it at about $17.
然后我进场大概是19块陆续进场
Then I started buying in around $19, gradually.
然后后来他CEO就带头卖股
Later, the CEO led the way in selling shares.
卖了好像4万股吧
Sold about 40,000 shares, I think.
对然后股价就崩到好像剩7块
Yeah, and the stock crashed to about $7.
OK就19跌到7块跌了大概60几%
Okay, so from $19 to $7, a drop of over 60%.
对然后这样子大概维持了一两年
Yeah, and it stayed like that for a year or two.
我一年还是两年我忘记了
I forget if it was one or two years.
反正我应该有抱好几个月至少
Anyway, I held on for at least a few months.
然后一直到他股价回到
Then, when the stock went back to
好像1112块还是13块的时候我卖掉
around $11 or $12, maybe $13, I sold.
然后接下来隔天就
And then the very next day,
对隔天就涨到150块
yeah, the next day it surged to $150.
哇当时有什么消息吗
Wow, was there any news at the time?
就是应该就是好像是
It was probably something like,
就是加密货币他有一些就是好的消息
some positive news related to cryptocurrency.
所以他这个股价就上去了
So the stock price shot up.
所以这个故事再次告诉我们说
So this story reminds us once again
就是DCA的重要性
of the importance of DCA.
那我们其实在市场当中
In the market, we really need
就是要定期定额的去布局
to invest regularly and consistently
一个你长期看好的东西
in something you’re bullish on long-term.
对因为我们永远不知道他什么时候会涨
Yeah, because we never know when it will rise.
对因为我们一开始投资大家都是
Exactly, because when we start investing,
大家看听信一些什么博主也好
we often listen to some bloggers
或者是一些大家分享
or hear shared opinions
或者是操盘手
or follow market manipulators.
说哪支股票会涨你就无脑去投
They say a stock will rise, so you blindly invest,
上杠杆做多
even using leverage to go long.
上杠杆做多我是没有
I haven’t used leverage to go long,
但是我相信很多人会做这件事情
but I believe many people do this.
因为大家都是抱
Because everyone holds onto
就是我觉得Derek每天都在一直
this idea, and I think Derek keeps
告诉大家一样的事情
telling everyone the same thing.
就是不要投机你现在是在投资
Don’t speculate; you’re investing now.
我其实比较少放在交易市场上面
I actually focus less on the trading market
因为我以前对我投资的理念
because my investment philosophy in the past
就是说与其我放钱
was that instead of putting money
在这个我不熟悉的领域
into an unfamiliar field
或者是我不熟悉的专业上面
or a profession I don’t know well,
我宁愿把这些钱拿来投资我自己
I’d rather invest that money in myself.
投资我公司
Invest in my company.
所以我们公司才可以从这个1000尺的规模
That’s how our company grew from 1,000 square feet
发展到3万尺
to 30,000 square feet.
这就是我们把赚来的钱
This is us reinvesting the money we earned
基本上都投入在这个公司上面
basically all back into the company.
这就是我的投资
That’s my investment.
所以大家要记得投资自己的
So everyone should remember to invest in themselves.
这个投资报酬率永远是最高的
The return on this investment is always the highest.
永远是最高因为这个东西
Always the highest because this thing
在在你脑海里
is in your mind.
他是不会不见的
It can’t disappear.
这只有这个东西他不会被任何的事物
Only this thing can’t be taken away by any event
或者是世界上发生任何的事情
or anything that happens in the world.
他不会被夺走
It can’t be stolen.
那其他的东西都是你很容易
Everything else is something you can easily
包括你的财富包括你的银行
lose, including your wealth, your bank account,
包括你所有的东西都是
everything you own.
很有可能在一个金融海啸
It’s very possible in a financial crisis
或很有可能在一场战争里面
or during a war,
你就什么都没有了
you could lose everything.
对说到这个Alex还有一个
Speaking of this, Alex, there’s another thing.
就是其实大部分成功人士
Actually, most successful people
都有拥有的一个特点
share a common trait.
就是他不会去投资一些他不懂的东西
They don’t invest in things they don’t understand.
就是他今天他一定要研究了之后
They only get involved after
做了功课之后他觉得这个东西好像还行
researching and doing their homework, thinking it’s viable.
他才会接触在上面
Only then do they engage with it.
那这个包含了就是
This includes the fact that
因为大部分现在的年轻人很多人
many young people nowadays,
他们不管是进入到加密货币的市场
whether entering the crypto market
或者是股票他们都不做功课
or stocks, don’t do their research.
他们就因为某某人说了这个会涨
They just buy because someone said it would go up.
他们就去买
And they just buy.
然后一跌了就怪东怪西的
Then when it drops, they blame everyone else
然后都不去检讨自己
and don’t reflect on themselves.
为什么没有做功课做这件事情
Why didn’t they do their homework before doing this?
那Alex你曾经有跟我讲过说
Alex, you once told me that
就是当时FedEx的股票
with FedEx stock at the time,
就是也是运输业嘛
which is also in the transportation industry,
对那他跌到很低的时候
when it dropped very low,
你是完全不会紧张的
you weren’t nervous at all.
原因就是因为你对于他比较了解嘛
The reason being you understood it better.
对因为像FedEx那时候
Yes, because with FedEx at that time,
他之所以会暴跌的原因
the reason it plummeted
因为他跟亚马逊已经就是解约了
was because it had terminated its contract with Amazon.
就亚马逊
It was Amazon.
亚马逊不做就不给FedEx包裹
Amazon stopped giving packages to FedEx.
但我其实因为我在这一行
But since I'm in this industry,
我很了解这个后面的背后原因
I understand the reasons behind this.
因为亚马逊是这样
This is how Amazon operates.
他把最好派送的区域
They take the easiest delivery areas
他拿来给物流业者投标
and open them for bidding to logistics providers.
那把比较相次好的
Then, the less desirable areas,
就是方圆大概15到20迈的这种包裹
like packages within a 15 to 20-mile radius,
是发包给UPS
are outsourced to UPS.
那把距离他们物流中心
And packages beyond 50 miles
50迈以外的包裹
from their logistics centers
全部发给FedEx
are all given to FedEx.
那也就是说他单一趟
That means, for a single trip,
他的人力运输成本是非常非常高
the labor and transport costs are extremely high.
因为你要知道美国的不不管是卡车也好
You have to understand, in the US, whether it's trucks,
油也好人也好都非常的贵
fuel, or labor, everything is very expensive.
那你今天送一个包裹
If you deliver one package today,
亚马逊可能就只给你6块钱4块钱
Amazon might only pay you 6 or 4 dollars.
那你你要送一个50迈的包裹
But delivering a package 50 miles away,
你可能今天倒贴都不止
you might even lose money on it.
那我觉得对我来讲
From my perspective,
我觉得这个生意当然是不能做了
I think this business is not worth doing.
那看对因为他虽然体量非常非常大
Even though the volume is huge,
但是你要知道亚马逊背后
you have to realize that behind Amazon,
他要做的就是取代这个UPS
their goal is to replace UPS.
那事实上已证明有数据
In fact, data has already proven this.
就是在2024年的时候
By 2024,
就是亚马逊配送的包裹已经超越UPS
Amazon's delivered packages have surpassed UPS,
已经超过这个经营100年的
exceeding a logistics company
这个美国境内物流公司
that’s been operating in the US for 100 years.
所以亚马逊现在已经是
So now, Amazon is
这个美国物流龙头
the leading logistics player in the US.
所以他当你今天你的客人想
So when your client today wants
他唯一想要做的事情
only one thing,
是把你给取代掉的时候
which is to replace you,
这生意是不能做的
this business is not worth doing.
对这生意是不能做
Yes, this business isn’t viable.
那FedEx对我来讲
For FedEx, in my opinion,
我觉得他是比较有远见的
I think they are more forward-thinking.
他就是他的布局不是在美国本土
Their strategy isn’t focused on the US domestic market.
因为像UPS他是专精在美国本土
UPS specializes in the US domestic market,
因为对可能美国民众来讲
because for many Americans,
FedEx跟UPS他们都是一样的东西
FedEx and UPS seem the same.
他就是反正就是我丢了他就会送到
They just think, "I send it, and it gets delivered."
但他没有去了解到
But they don’t realize
这个物流公司的本质他是不一样的
that the core of these logistics companies is different.
那UPS他是比较著重在
UPS focuses more on
这个美国本土的派送
domestic US deliveries,
那FedEx他是比较著重在国际的派送
while FedEx emphasizes international deliveries.
那他扩点的策略他是先
Their expansion strategy starts with
他在每一个国家他先去买下
acquiring customs brokers
那个国家的报关行
in every country.
对所以他就是等于说
Yes, so it’s like
我先在每一个国家
they first establish a foothold
他先布下来一个这个路口
in every country.
所以他在后面他再去拓展他的
So later, when they expand their
物流派送派送网的时候
logistics and delivery networks,
他就会变得非常的有优势
they gain a significant advantage.
你常常像UPS的包裹
You often see UPS packages
可能在海关他就已经卡住了
getting stuck at customs.
他甚至进不去那个国家
They might not even enter the country.
那甚至他到其他国家
And in other countries,
他需要委外委外就第三方去做派送
they need to outsource delivery to third parties.
那他这个在国际的物流包裹上面
So, in terms of international logistics,
UPS就相对比较弱势
UPS is relatively weaker.
但是他在美国是目前还是最强的
But in the US, it's still the strongest for now.
对但是他的包裹量
However, its package volume
也已经被亚马逊给取代掉了
has already been surpassed by Amazon.
亚马逊这个平台
Amazon as a platform
但他就是一直就是在抢自己客人
is constantly taking over its own customers.
他是一个金融怪兽
It's a financial monster.
他就是会把所有东西吃掉
It just devours everything.
他就是你今天你产品在亚马逊卖得好
If your product sells well on Amazon,
他就会去联系你的供货厂
they'll contact your supplier,
然后贴上他们自己的标
put their own label on it,
跟你卖一样的产品
and sell the same product as you.
然后把你比较便宜
Then they undercut your price
然后把你的listing压下去
and push down your listing.
不让你曝光
They limit your exposure,
然后让你的review越来越低
causing your reviews to drop,
流量越来越小
and your traffic to shrink.
然后他们去把你取代掉
Then they replace you entirely.
这真的是非常黑有个朋友
This is really shady. I have a friend
他也是做鞋子的
who also sells shoes.
他在亚马逊上卖鞋的
He sells shoes on Amazon,
然后真的是被抽烂
and he's been completely ripped off.
就那个commission真的被抽
The commission fees are insane.
但早期你做亚马逊很爽
In the early days, Amazon was great,
但是以前很爽
really awesome back then.
但是这个所以这个东西就是我觉得
But this is why I think
因为像我也有朋友做亚马逊
I have friends who sell on Amazon too.
已经做20年了
They’ve been doing it for 20 years.
那当然前期做的时候是赚非常多钱
Of course, they made a lot of money in the beginning.
那现在的话也是很惨
But now, it’s pretty bad.
因为他就是无故他会去锁你的帐号
They’ll lock your account for no reason,
会挑你一些小毛病他去锁你帐号
finding minor issues to suspend you.
那你是完全就是没办法再有这个流量了
Then you completely lose your traffic.
你你的货物会出不去
Your goods can’t be shipped out,
那你会stock在那边
and they’re stuck there.
就非常的无助
It’s incredibly frustrating.
那这个东西其实你过度
This happens when you overly
不管在你今天在做生意也好
rely on a single resource, whether in business
或者是你做任何事情也好
or anything else you do.
你过度依赖一个资源
Over-dependence on one source
都对你来讲是一个很有风险的事情
is always a risky thing for you.
像我们投资一样
It’s like with investments,
你过度依赖在一个某一种币上面
if you rely too much on a single currency
或者是某一种股票上面
or a single stock,
都是非常有风险的
it’s extremely risky.
OK那这个最后我想跟Alex聊一下
OK, lastly, I want to chat with Alex
接下来十年这个
about the next decade.
有没有什么特别的目标啊
Do you have any specific goals?
有没有什么想要买的东西啊
Anything you want to buy?
或者想做的事情
Or things you want to do?
因为基本上我觉得你现在应该是
Because I feel like at this point,
要买什么都可以
you can probably buy anything.
就只是想不想的问题
It's just a matter of whether you want to or not.
然后做什么事情应该也都是可以
And you can probably do anything you want.
那在接下来十年你有什么计划吗
So, do you have any plans for the next ten years?
就是对公司的计划
Like plans for your company?
然后对自己个人
And for yourself personally?
有没有特别想要做的事情
Is there anything special you want to do?
我基本上是一个将生活
I’m basically someone who integrates work into life.
将工作融入在生活里面的人
So, my work is a big part of my life.
所以我基本上就是想做的事情
The things I want to do are mostly related to work.
基本上都是工作上的事情
So, my focus is on work-related goals.
所以我就希望把这个的点
I hope to expand our presence more and more.
可以越扩越多
To have more locations.
在美国就是东岸也好
In the US, whether it’s the East Coast,
甚至是这个美国南部的部分
or even parts of the southern US,
德州啊芝加哥啊纽约啊
like Texas, Chicago, or New York.
都可以有我们EasyGo的点
I want EasyGo locations everywhere.
那未来在亚洲地区也希望
And in the future, in Asia as well,
就是有更好的发展
I hope for better development.
那自己个人呢
And personally?
有没有想要买什么东西啊
Is there anything you want to buy?
买个车啊买个表啊有没有这种
Like a car or a watch, anything like that?
买车都找你啊
I’ll come to you for a car!
买车我对这些物欲相对比较还好
Buying a car? I’m not too driven by material desires.
就是你说没有是不会
It’s not that I don’t have any,
但是我对这些我觉得
but I think for me,
就是满足个人需求吧
it’s about meeting personal needs.
就像你说的就怎么舒服怎么来
Like you said, it’s about being comfortable.
对怎么舒服怎么来
Yeah, comfort is key.
就是我觉得最重要的东西还是陪家人啦
I think the most important thing is spending time with family.
就是陪著小孩长大这个是
Being there as my kids grow up.
对因为这个陪小孩子长大
Because watching your kids grow,
这个是无可逆行的一个时间
that’s an irreversible time.
就是他们孩子长大的速度非常快
Kids grow up so fast.
你看Aden现在已经是
Look at Aden, he’s already
快要六岁了已经快六岁了
almost six years old, nearly six!
对我大儿子也是五岁半了嘛
Yeah, my eldest son is five and a half.
所以这个大的速度非常快
So, they grow up really quickly.
那我觉得很感伤啦
It makes me feel quite sentimental.
就是这个过程当中真的是只有一次
This process only happens once.
就是他只有一次三岁只有一次四岁
They’re only three once, only four once.
然后这个过程当中有非常非常多
And during this time, there are so many
无价的回忆
priceless memories.
然后这些东西是我不会
These are things I wouldn’t
为了任何金钱牺牲的
sacrifice for any amount of money.
就是在接下来可能Aden六岁到
In the coming years, from Aden being six
18岁成年的这个过程当中
to 18 when he’s an adult,
我不想要错过他任何一个
I don’t want to miss any
成长的重要的moment
important moments of his growth.
对所以是非常非常重要的
Yeah, it’s incredibly important.
所以最后做个总结
So, to wrap things up,
就是希望大家
I hope everyone
这个在赚钱努力的同时
while working hard to make money,
永远不要忘了赚钱的初衷
never forgets the original purpose of earning.
还是要让自己开心
It’s still about making yourself happy,
让自己做自己想要做的事情
doing what you want to do,
陪自己想要陪的人
being with the people you care about.
这些东西是最重要的
These are the most important things.
然后也没有办法用任何金钱去定义的
And they can’t be defined by any amount of money.
