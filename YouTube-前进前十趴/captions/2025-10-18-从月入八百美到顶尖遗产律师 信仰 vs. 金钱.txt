欢迎回到前进前十趴。
今天请到的是我非常非常好的朋友，
这也是我们频道第一次用全英文进行访谈。
呃，他叫Benjamin。
Uh, his name is Benjamin.
Benjamin，今天过得如何？
Benjamin, how are you doing today?
很高兴见到你。我很好。
It's very good to see you. I'm doing great.
好吧，我们认识大概有，
Okay, so we know each other for like,
我想超过十年了吧？
I think over a decade?
对吧？
Right?
对，我想可能是
Yeah, I was thinking maybe
大约12年了。
about 12 years, actually.
对。所以，嗯，我和Benjamin，
Right. So, um, me and Benjamin,
我们是在CrossFit健身房认识的。
we met at the CrossFit gym.
没错。
That's right.
早上六点的课程，然后
6:00 a.m. class, and
我们一起做了大概
then we've been doing it together for
五、六年，对吧？
maybe five, five or six years, right?
没错。
That's right.
每天，呃，我和Ben
Every day, uh, me and Ben's
都会见面
gonna meet each other
在早上六点的CrossFit健身房。
at the CrossFit gym at 6:00 a.m.
我们这样持续了大约五
and we have been doing it for like five
年。
years.
后来因为疫情而停了。
Eventually we stopped because of COVID.
没错。
That's right.
但在那段时间，是我
But then during that time, it was one of my
最棒的时期
greatest run
在我的CrossFit生涯中。
for my CrossFit career.
因为
Because
CrossFit非常难，非常非常难。
CrossFit is very hard, very, very hard.
我知道你还在继续，对吧？
I know you're still doing it, right?
我还在做，是的。
I am still doing it, yeah.
好吧，所以
Okay, so
基本上，呃，对我来说，疫情后，
basically, uh, for me, like after, uh,
疫情后，
COVID,
然后显然我搬到了Chino，
and then obviously I moved to Chino
接著又搬到Irvine。
and then I moved to Irvine.
对我来说很难，呃，
It's very hard for me to, uh,
继续下去，没有
continue it without
像你这样的伙伴。
a pal like you.
对，你说得对，很难做到。
Yeah, you're right. It's hard to do that.
因为以前是每天早上六点，
Because it used to be like 6:00 a.m. every
有你、我还有Alex，对吧？
day, it's you, me, and Alex, right?
那真的非常非常有趣。
And then that makes it really, really fun.
每次有人没出现，
And then every time one guy doesn't showed
然后，
up,
我们另外两个就会
and then we kind of, the other two
互相督促，
kind of count each other,
像是互相负责。
like we count each other accountable.
所以这其实让我想每次都出现。
So it actually makes me want to showed up
每次都去。
every time.
而且我们分享彼此的生活。
And you share each other's lives.
没错。然后我们会聊
Exactly. And then we we get to talk about
生活，
life,
聊事业，还有
talk about career, and then talk about
很多事情。
a lot of stuff.
所以基本上，嗯，你看著我成长。
So basically, um, you saw me grow up.
你不觉得吗？
Don't you think?
我们一起经历了起起伏伏，是的。
We've been through some ups and downs, yes.
我们第一次见面时，我大概27
So when we first met, I was like maybe 27
或28岁，
or 28,
我想你当时快要
and I think you were just approaching
40岁，如果不是40就是41。
40, if not 40, 41.
对，但运动能力上
Yeah, but athletically
我们完全一样。为什么会这样？
we were exactly the same. Why is that?
对，然后我们在聊
Yeah, and then we're we're
你好像在
talking about like you're reaching
42岁达到巅峰。
your peak at 42.
对，我在42岁达到巅峰，然后
Yes, I I peaked at 42 and
不，早就过了。
No, it's way over that.
我早就过了那个阶段。
I'm way past that.
还有Alex，我
And then also Alex, I
记得第一次见他时，
I remember the first time I met him,
他，呃，38岁。
he's uh, 38.
而我现在已经超过那个年纪了。
And then I'm already over that age now.
我快要40岁了。
I'm approaching 40.
所以时间，呃，
So time is, uh,
就像
like
基本上就像弹指一瞬
it it's just basically like snap
一眨眼
of the finger
感觉就像十年过去了。
and then feel like a decade just passed by.
那你觉得我怎么样？
And what what what do you think about me?
你觉得，呃，
Like, do you do you think, um,
你觉得我的成熟度如何？
what do you think about my maturity?
有些人，我的观众
Like some people, some of my viewers
可能看不到
might not be able to see
我的这一面，因为，呃，
that side of me because, uh,
我的频道是四年前开的。
I had my channel four years ago.
嗯。
Mhm.
那过去十年你看到了什么？
So what did you see in the past 10 years?
我是如何从一个
How I transformed from a
呃，小子变成一个男人。
um, kid to a man.
嗯，你其实不算小子。
Well, you weren't really a kid.
我的意思是，你，
I mean, you were,
当我第一次见到你时，你
when I first met you, you
已经是个生意人了
were already a business owner
当时。你记得吗？
at the time. You remember?
而且你已经，呃，
And you you'd already, um,
你已经在职场上
you'd already been in the working world
工作了几年。
for a few years.
你做过一些不同的事情。
You you'd done some different things.
嗯，我们一起经历了
Um, we went through
一些，呃，挑战性的
through some, uh, challenging
嗯，
um,
你经历的一些事情。
experiences that you had.
我不知道有多少
I don't know how much
感情上的？
Romantically?
对，你经历的感情事
Yes, romantic experiences that you had
和，呃，前女友们。
with, uh, ex-girlfriends.
对，前女友们
Yeah, ex-girlfriends
以及那些挑战
and the challenges of that
还有试图应对，呃，
and trying to navigate, um,
然后，呃，你
And then, uh, you
知道，我在你认识你太太时在场
know, I was there when you met your wife
还有，嗯，所有那些小小的追求过程
and, um, all all that little, that courtship
你们之间的交往
that you you guys had
约会等等，还有
and the dating and everything and
嗯，我参加了你的婚礼
um, I was there at your wedding and
还有当你第一个孩子出生时
um, when you had your first baby and
嗯，对。
um, yeah.
我也在你宝宝出生的那晚在场。
I I was there the night your baby was born.
哦，对，对，没错。
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's right.
没错。
That's right.
所以，基本上，呃，
So, so basically, uh,
我觉得那对我来说像是沉重的
I I I feel like that was like a crushing
打击。
blow to me.
就像我的事业，直到这一点，
Like for my career, uh, up until this point,
嗯，前女友的事，分手，
um, the ex-girlfriend thing, the breakup,
嗯，麻烦的
um, the troubling
生意上的问题。
with the with the business.
然后在那段时间，
And then during that time,
我觉得那就像是
I think that was like
我人生的低谷，我觉得。
the low of my life, I think.
然后在那段时间，
And then during that time,
我不知道我是否能撑过去
I don't know if I was able to survive
如果没有CrossFit，也没有你。
without CrossFit and then without you.
真的吗？
Really?
我的意思是，你在那段时间展现了很多毅力
I mean, you showed a lot of perseverance
度过了那段时期。
through that time.
但那时我正在经历一些
But then I was going through like some
真正、真正的困难。
really, really hardship.
然后我觉得在那段时间，
And then I feel like during that time,
CrossFit，
CrossFit,
每天出现，然后有
um, showing up every day and then having
像你这样的人，甚至还有Alex，
somebody like you and even Alex,
我觉得尤其是你
I think you specifically
因为我们更多地谈论
because we talk more in terms of like
详细的个人
the detailed personal
生活之类的。
life and stuff like that.
所以，我觉得那真的是
So, I I feel like that was
非常非常有帮助。然后
really, really helpful. And then
我觉得我没有机会
I don't think I had the opportunity to
跟你说这些。
to tell you that.
因为在那段时间，
Because during that time,
第一次，是的。
First time, yes.
是的，所以在那段时间，嗯，
Yeah, so during that time, um,
我真的非常沮丧。
I was really, really defeated.
老实说，我在那时真的被击垮了
And I I I to be honest, I was quite crushed
在那段时间。
during that time.
无论是感情上还是事业上。
Whether romantically or like business side.
我正在经历一些
I was going through like some
非常非常困难的事情。
really, really hardship.
而且我其实
And I was actually
负债累累。
like in debt.
我处于一个非常糟糕的境地。
I was in a really, really bad spot.
所以，参加CrossFit
So, showing up in CrossFit
真的非常非常帮助了我。
really, really, really helped me.
我觉得，是的。
I feel like, yeah.
在那段时间，当一切都
During that time, so when everything was
看似无望时，
seemed hopeless,
我觉得每天出现在CrossFit
I feel like showing up at CrossFit
早上六点，是一个
every day at 6:00 a.m. was a
巨大的改变。
huge difference.
是的。
Yeah.
帮助你度过难关。
Helped you make it through.
然后跟你聊天也是一个巨大的
And then talking to you was a huge
改变。
difference.
然后，嗯，我知道我从没说过，嗯，
And then, uh, I I know I never say this, uh,
在你面前。
in front of you.
我觉得你是唯一一个我，不
I think you're the only person I, not
唯一的人，
only person,
但我觉得你是
but I feel like you are
嗯，我认识的人中
um, somebody like I know with
最有智慧的。
the most wisdom.
真的吗？
Really?
是的，我觉得你是我认识的
Yeah, I think you're one of the smartest
最聪明的人之一。
people I know.
嗯，我见过很多，嗯，
Um, I have met a lot of, uh,
谢谢你，Derek，很客气。
It's very kind of you, Derek.
我知道。
I know.
我跟你不太习惯这样。
I'm not used to this with you.
我知道。只是因为我
I know. Just because I I
想跟你说很多我
want to tell you a lot of stuff that I
这些年来的感受
I feel over the years
因为，嗯，显然做这生意，
because, uh, obviously doing this business,
我遇过一些每年赚
I have met people who makes
几千万美元的人。
tens of millions of dollar every year.
但我觉得赚钱
But then I feel like making money
和拥有智慧是两回事。
and having wisdom is two different things.
是的，没错。
Yeah, that's right.
很多人非常有钱，
A lot of people, they are really rich,
非常富有，
they're really wealthy,
但他们的性格很糟糕。
but then they have a terrible personality.
然后他们没有与财富
And then they don't have the wisdom
相匹配的智慧。
to to to match their wealth.
而你是那种人
And then you're one of those person
我一直尊敬的人。
I I always respect.
所以，我想要听听你的看法。
So, I I I I want to hear from your side.
比如你如何看我从
Like how how you see me develop from
28岁到现在的发展。
a 28 years old till now.
我的意思是，这
I mean, it's
非常惊人。
it's tremendous.
我的意思是，你，嗯，
I mean, you've, um,
我想我见过你最低谷的时候
I I I guess I've seen you at your lowest
就像你自己说的。
low, as from your own words.
而现在你做得，嗯，
And now you're just doing, um,
我的意思是，美满的家庭，
I mean, beautiful family,
嗯，可爱的小男孩。
um, beautiful little boy.
嗯，你现在是个父亲了。
Um, you know, you're a father now.
嗯，生活中发生了很多
Um, lots of wonderful
美好的事情。
things happening in your life.
而且你的事业发展得非常好。
And your business is going so great.
嗯，你知道，你是个巨星。
Um, you know, you're a superstar.
你真是个巨星，而且
You're a superstar and
所以，我觉得，别别
So, so I feel like, don't don't
你不觉得我有点，呃，
you feel like I was a little bit, uh,
我总觉得
I I always feel like
当我年轻时，比如二十出头，
when I was younger, like in my early 20s,
我有点自大。
I was a little bit cocky.
有点傲慢。
A lot of a little bit of arrogance.
我的意思是，我们在那个年纪都自大，
I mean, we we all are cocky,
我想是这样。
I think at that age.
但我觉得随著我的成长，
But I feel like as I I was developing,
随著我变得
as I get
更自在，
more comfortable,
然后我也变得更谦虚
and then I become more humble
同时。
at the same time.
我觉得你智慧增长了很多，
I think you've grown in a lot of wisdom,
从那些日子以来。
actually, since those days.
我想变得像你一样。
I try to be like you.
我是说，你做到了。你
I mean, you have. You
做到了。你曾经，呃，
have. You you were, um,
我不会说自大，也许是理想主义。
I wouldn't say cocky, idealistic maybe.
而现在你可能
And now maybe you're
更现实一点。
a little bit more realistic.
因为当你看到，
Because when you see,
当你看到有人赚这么多钱，
when you see people making so much money,
当你看到有人如此成功，
when you see like people like so successful,
你会有点
you kind of
像以前年轻时，
like like before when you're younger,
当我二十出头时，
when I was in my early 20s,
我总觉得我是最好的。
I I always feel like I was the best.
我觉得我什么都能做。
I I was able to do everything.
然后当你看到
And then when you see like
有些人比你有更多成就
people who have so much more achievement
比你强
than you
而且他们非常谦虚，
and then they're so humble,
这会让你变得谦虚。
it kind of humble you in a way.
是的。
Yeah.
然后我觉得有
And then I I feel like people with
真正智慧的人
true wisdom
会从这个过程中学习。
is going to learn from that process.
因为很多人，
Because a lot of people,
他们从不学习，对吧？
they just never learn, right?
然后当他们赚更多
And then as they make me more
钱时，他们变得更自大。
money, they just become more cocky.
所以，我觉得金钱
So, I feel like money
有时可以是放大镜
sometimes can be a magnifier
反映你真正的样子。
to how you how you really are.
没错。
That's true.
对吧？它放大了个性。
Right? It magnify the personality.
如果你是个很好的人，
If you are a really good person,
我觉得如果你有更多钱，
I think if you have more money,
那么你可以做更多好事。
then you can do a lot more goods.
我觉得你的
I feel like you're the
生活基础必须是某种
foundation of your life has to be something
除了金钱之外的东西
other than money
因为有钱的时候，
because with money, there's
永远不够，永远。
never really enough, ever.
正是。
Exactly.
所以，呃，Benjamin 是一位信托律师。
So, um, Benjamin is a a trust attorney.
而且，呃，在他的领域非常成功。
And then, um, very successful in his field.
然后，呃，怎样
And then, um, how how
你是怎么成为律师的？
how did you become a attorney?
成长过程是怎样的，
Like what's the growing, like
那是什么过程？
what's the process for that?
因为我个人认识你，
Because knowing you personally,
我觉得律师
I don't think attorney
不是很符合
is the something that matches
你的个性
your personality
因为你非常放松。
because you are really relaxed.
我们讨论过这个话题
We've had this conversation
很多次，你说，是的。
many times where you say, yes.
是的。所以，我一直非常非常好奇。
Yeah. So, I I was always very, very curious.
像你是怎么成为律师的
Like how you become an attorney
因为你是如此善良的人，
because you are such a kind person,
非常慷慨。
very generous.
然后，嗯，
And then, um,
传统上人们认为律师
just traditionally people think attorney
是，嗯，
as, um,
必须很强硬，
you have to be like hard-nosed,
很会争斗。
hard fighting.
就像你总得表现得很凶
Like you have to always show like a mean
一样。
face.
你得争论，
You have to like argue, you
得提出你的观点。
have to like make your points.
嗯，
Um,
我也有那一面。
And you I I have that side of me.
我是说，他们
I I mean, they
在法学院时会训练你这些，
they train you for that when
就是这样，
you're in law school
但这不是我的本性。
that way, but it's not my nature.
好吧，那么告诉
Okay, so so so tell
我关于你的事，比如你怎么长大的。
me about you like like how you grew up.
我知道你是来自密苏里州，对吧？
I I know you are from Missouri, right?
我在密苏里州长大。
I grew up in Missouri.
然后，告诉我你是如何
And then, uh, tell me about how you
从一个孩子走到今天的。
go from a kid till where you are today.
嗯，我是，
Uh, well, I was, uh,
在密苏里州出生长大，
born and raised in Missouri,
我认为是一个典型的中西部家庭。
a typical, I think Midwestern family.
对。
Right.
所以，我成长在一个白人
So, uh, I grew up in kind of a white
美国文化中。
American culture.
嗯，我不认识任何中国人。
Um, I didn't know any Chinese people.
完全不认识。
At all.
嗯，所以，但我上了大学
Um, so, and but I I went to college
在堪萨斯城，
in Kansas City
我有机会去，嗯，留学
and I got the opportunity to, uh, study
海外。
overseas.
所以我去了香港学习了一年。
So I went and I I studied in Hong Kong for
一年。
a year.
Benjamin也会说普通话，如果你们，
Benjamin also speaks Mandarin, if you guys,
我知道你们会很震惊，但
I I know you guys will be shocked, but
他确实会说，嗯，普通话，
then he actually speaks, uh, Mandarin
而且他能听懂大部分普通话。
and he understand most Mandarin.
大概80%，也许70%？
So like 80%, maybe 70%?
大约80%。对。
About 80%. Yeah.
好吧，所以，嗯，什么
Okay, so, yeah, um, what
在香港发生了，
happened in Hong Kong
然后你做了什么？
and then what did you do?
嗯，我在那里学习，然后，嗯，
Well, I studied there and then, um,
那真的是我第一次与中国人
I that was really my first interaction
接触。
with Chinese people.
好。
Okay.
然后我，嗯，我回来了，感觉
And then I, um, I came back and I kind of
我经历了反向文化冲击。
think I went through reverse culture shock.
好。
Okay.
然后我，嗯，总之，
And I, um, anyway,
我回来了，我一直想，嗯，
I I came back and I'd always wanted to, um,
将我的生命奉献给重要的事情。
give my life to the things that matter.
好。
Okay.
其中一件重要的事情
And one of those things that mattered
是我与上帝的关系。
in my life was my relationship with God.
好。
Okay.
所以我回来后，我实际上参与了
So I, when I came back, I actually became
堪萨斯城的一个华人教会。
involved in a Chinese church in Kansas City.
哦。
Oh.
对。
Yeah.
有意思。
Interesting.
我在那个教会担任职员
And I I was on staff on that church
作为牧师大约八年。
as a minister for about eight years.
好。
Okay.
通过那段经历，那真的是
And through that experience, that's
我中文能力巩固的地方。
really where a lot of my Chinese solidified.
你知道，我在香港
You know, I I've kind of learned in Hong
学了一点，但后来，
Kong, but then I I was,
我知道这听起来很奇怪，我在
I know it sounds strange. I learned
香港学了普通话。
Mandarin in Hong Kong.
嗯，但，嗯，总之，
Um, but, um, anyway,
那是我学习的地方
that's where I learned it
而且我能够在那段时间
and and I was able to kind of develop it
在那期间
during that
那些年里
during those years as
作为华人教会的牧师，逐渐发展它。
a as a minister in the Chinese church.
你从小就是基督徒吗？
Were you always a Christian growing up or?
嗯，我是，我在
Um, I was, I became a Christian
九岁时成为基督徒。
when I was nine.
好的，很早。
Okay, so pretty early.
但我的父母其实，嗯，
But my parents didn't really, um,
我的父母是很好的人，
my parents were really good people,
但他们可能只是圣诞节
but they were kind of maybe Christmas
和复活节那种基督徒。
and Easter type of Christians.
好的。
Okay.
嗯，后来在他们的生活中，
Um, and later on in their life,
在我们上大学离家后，
kind of after we left for college,
他们开始更规律地去教会。
they started going more consistently.
但其实是我的祖母
Uh, but it was my grandmother
带我们去教会的。
that took us to church.
好的。
Okay.
还有我的
And my and then other
除此之外，我的父母会把我们放下
than that, my mom and dad kind of dropped
然后
us off
回家看报纸。
and went home to read the paper.
好的。
Okay.
有没有某个时刻你真的
Was there really a point where you really
真心相信耶稣？
truly believe in Jesus Jesus?
还是说你在九岁时就
Or or you were nine and then
因为九岁时，没人
because because nine years old, nobody
真正懂所有事情。
really knew everything.
那是很单纯的，对吧？
It's very two-dimensional, right?
嗯，嗯，
Um, um,
那个，那个经历，我的
the the experience, my
当时与神的经历是
experience with God at that point was
我，
I I
我想做祂希望我做的事，
I wanted to do what he wanted me to do,
嗯，我相信那是正确的路。
um, and I believed it was the right way.
但直到我大概
But it really wasn't until I was
12岁时，
probably about 12,
嗯，我想我从没告诉过你这件事。
um, I don't think I've ever told you this.
没有。
No.
呃，我最好的朋友自杀了。
Uh, my best friend committed suicide.
12岁？
At 12?
12岁。
At 12.
什么？
What?
是的，当我，嗯，是的，那是
Yeah, when I was, um, yeah, and that was
对我来说真的是非常非常
a really, really challenging
具有挑战性的经历。
experience for me.
嗯，
Um,
他是怎么做的？
How did he do that?
我不知道，因为我才12岁，我不太
I don't, since I was 12, I don't really
了解所有细节。
understand all the details.
我是说，那真是
I mean, it was such a
而且我很多事情都
and a lot of this I've
必须在情感上慢慢处理。
had to kind of work through emotionally.
嗯，但他，他
Um, but he was, he
在家里能拿到枪。
had access to a gun in the house.
哦，哇。
Oh, wow.
而且他，但最疯狂的是我
And he, but the crazy thing about it was I
他是我的朋友。
he was like my friend.
我每天都和他聊天，
And I was talking to him every day,
每天，
every day,
但我完全不知道
and I didn't know anything
他身上发生了什么。
about what was going on with him.
你知道，你必须原谅
You know, and you kind of have to forgive
自己作为一个12岁的孩子
yourself as a 12-year-old
因为12岁的孩子通常很
because 12-year-olds are kind of very
专注于自己
focused on themselves
而不关注其他人。
and not focused on other people.
呃，但那件事彻底震撼了我的世界。
Uh, but it it rocked my world at that point.
那是，我记得
And that was, I remember
那真是非常困难
it was so difficult
能够处理这些情感问题
to be able to work through those issues
在情感上
emotionally
而且我的父母尽了他们最大的努力。
and and my parents did the best they could.
我的意思是，他们真的是好人。
I mean, they're really good people.
他们试图
They're trying to
帮助一个不知道该怎么做的小孩。
help a kid who doesn't know what to do.
嗯，但那是第一次经历
Uh, but that was the first experience
让我意识到
where I realized that I
不只是相信正确的事，
it's not just about believing
而是
the right things,
在困难中依靠上帝。
it's about depending upon God
在困难的事情中依靠祂。
through hard things.
那是当时
And that was the hardest
我经历过最困难的事。
thing I'd ever been through at that point.
哇。
Wow.
嗯，但我在那个时候学到的教训
Um, but those lessons that I learned at at
在那个情感状态下
that emotional state
真的是开始塑造我的
was really what began to shape my
随著我长大对上帝的信任。
trusting God as I grew up.
嗯，你知道，我是基督徒，嗯，
Um, you know, and I'm a Christian, uh,
具体来说，
so specifically,
我是耶稣的追随者。
it's I'm a follower of Jesus.
嗯，但所有这些事情都塑造了我。
Um, but all those things shaped me.
嗯，
Um,
你知道，上帝从未让我失望。
and you know, God has never failed me.
嗯，有时候
Uh, there's there's
是我让祂失望了，
been times when I have failed him,
可能一次又一次，但
probably over and over again, but
嗯，当我信任祂时，
uh, when I've trusted him,
结果总是更好。
it always turns out better.
嗯，
Um,
总之，那是那是我的
So anyway, that's that's I I I
在我从香港回来后，
after I came back from Hong Kong,
嗯，我已经在考虑
um, I I was already thinking
进入事奉工作
about going into ministry
我已经在计划这件事。
and I was already planning that.
所以我去了，嗯，
And so I went and I, um,
我参与了这个华人
I got involved with this Chinese
教会，成为职员。
church and I became on staff.
然后我去了神学院。
And then I went to seminary.
你知道什么是神学院吗？
You know what seminary is?
知道。
Yeah.
嗯，所以我去了神学院，嗯，
Um, so I went to seminary and, um,
我其实以为我要教
I thought I was actually going to teach
神学院的旧约。
Old Testament in a seminary.
哦。
Oh.
所以我，嗯，我喜欢这些东西。
So I got, I mean, I love that stuff.
我知道，我跟你谈过这件事。
I I know. I've I've talked to you about this.
嗯，但，嗯，我喜欢，你知道，
And, um, but, uh, I love, you know,
圣经是用希伯来文和希腊文写的，
the the Bible's written in Hebrew and Greek,
所以我学了希伯来文和希腊文，
so I learned Hebrew and Greek and
嗯，我还学了考古学
uh, I I learned archaeology
和所有这些东西。
and all this stuff.
还有，嗯，
And, uh,
那是一段美好的时光。
it was a wonderful time.
就是在那个教会
And it was through that church
我遇到了我的妻子，
that I met my wife,
她是美国出生的华人。
who's American-born Chinese.
是啊。
Yeah.
嗯，我妻子的父亲得了
Um, and my wife's dad came down
癌症。
with with cancer.
哦。
Oh.
他得了，嗯，我跟你说过这件事吗？
He had, um, have I told you this?
没有。
No.
今天有很多新故事。
There's a lot of new stories today.
我不知道。
I didn't know.
我知道。
I know.
嗯，总之，他，嗯，
Um, anyway, he, um,
他们经营了一家相当成功的
they they ran a a pretty successful
堪萨斯城地区的中餐馆，
Chinese restaurant in the Kansas City area,
实际上是南堪萨斯城。
actually South Kansas City.
是啊。
Yeah.
嗯，在堪萨斯城南边的路易斯堡。
Uh, way south of Kansas City in in Lewisburg.
嗯，她是，嗯，
Um, and she was, uh,
他得了第四期癌症，然后
he he came down with stage four cancer and
突然之间，
all of a sudden,
嗯，他得了，嗯
um, he had, he
基本上只撑了四个月。
basically lasted about four months.
哦，哇。
Oh, wow.
然后他就去世了。
And then he passed away.
好快。
It's quick.
唯一的情况是，他是这家餐厅的主厨
The only thing was he was like the main cook
他是主要的...
of this restaurant.
他是主要的，嗯，
He was the main, um,
算是这生意的主导力量
kind of the the leading driving
和推动者。
force in this business.
但他没有...
And he didn't have, but
他是典型的移民
he was kind of a typical immigrant
在美国的家庭
family in the United States
他没有真正计划过，或者
where he hadn't really planned or
他不明白需要
he didn't he didn't understand what needed
做些什么。
to happen.
所以他没有做任何生意规划
So he had done no business planning
关于如果我不在了
on how to what would what
会发生什么事。
would happen if I'm not here.
他也没有做遗产规划。
He had done no estate planning.
那我的孩子会怎样，谁
So what would happen to my kids, who's
来管理钱财？
going to take care of the money?
他什么都没做。
He had done nothing.
而且他没有医疗保险。
So, and he had no health insurance.
哇。
Wow.
所以我们...
So we were,
你可以想像癌症的帐单。
you can imagine the cancer bills.
所以在那之前，你还没参与
So until that point, you haven't got involved
成为信托律师的路线？
to the route of becoming a trust attorney?
不，我...不是的，
No. I it wasn't, it was,
我是说，除了可能
I mean, other than maybe
有人向我提过，
someone kind of mentioning it to me,
那时我还不是律师。
I wasn't an attorney at this point.
那你之前学了什么？
So what did you study before that?
我...我的
I I I for my
大学本科是商科主修
undergrad, I was a business major
和传播学主修。
and a communications major.
哦，哇。
Oh, wow.
然后我去了神学院
And then I went to seminary
拿了神学硕士学位，
and I got a Master's of Divinity,
圣经考古学文学硕士，
a Master's of Arts in Biblical Archaeology,
以及圣经语言文学硕士。
and a Master's of Arts in Biblical Languages.
所以我拿了三个硕士
So I got three master's
学位，因为我以为我要
degrees because I thought I was going
去教旧约。
to teach Old Testament.
就在那时，我的妻子，
And and it was at that point that my wife,
嗯，她的父亲去世了，突然间，
um, her her dad died and all of a sudden,
我们当时其实在交往，
we were actually dating at
还没结婚。
that time. We weren't actually married.
但我们得为家人经营这家中餐馆
But we had to run the Chinese restaurant
。
for the family.
好。
Okay.
所以我，一个白人，之前
So here I was, a white person who had before
在那之前，
that,
我从未见过华人，你知道，
I'd never met a Chinese person, you know,
在我去香港之前。
before I went to Hong Kong.
我甚至不认识任何华人。
I didn't even know any Chinese people.
然后我就，嗯，
And then I, uh, kind
成为了这个世界的一部分，嗯，
of became a part of this world and, um,
突然间开始经营
and all of a sudden running
这家在堪萨斯城的中餐馆。
this Chinese restaurant in Kansas City.
那你是怎么成为信托律师的？
So how do you become a trust attorney?
是因为那时你看到了
Is it because of that point you see like how
这有多重要吗？
important it is?
是的，但花了我一段时间才走出来
Yes, but it took me a while to get out
。
of it.
好。
Okay.
因为，你知道，
Because, you know,
华人有很多，嗯，
Chinese people have a lot of, uh,
我不知道怎么说最好，
I don't I don't know the best way to say it,
关于死亡的迷信。
superstitions about death.
这样说合适吗？
Is that the best way to say it?
他们不愿意谈论这个。
They don't want to talk about it.
他们不愿意谈论，对吧？
They don't want to talk about it, right?
所以，嗯，
So, um,
你知道，我们试著
you know, we tried to
立即卖掉餐厅，
sell the restaurant immediately,
但因为餐厅笼罩著死亡的阴影，
but because the there was death hanging
换句话说，
over the restaurant,
我们无法
in other words, we
把它卖给另一个中国人。
couldn't sell it to another Chinese person.
所以大约一年内没人愿意和我们谈。
So nobody would talk to us for like a year.
哇。
Wow.
但我们还有这些癌症医疗费用。
But we had all these cancer bills.
所以我们不得不
So we had to
我和我的妻子，也就是当时的女友，
my wife and my girlfriend
一起经营这家餐厅。
and I had to run this restaurant.
她真是一位出色的生意人。
Now, she is a tremendous businesswoman.
我是说，你见过我妻子，她非常
I mean, you've you've met my wife. She's
非常聪明。
very, very smart.
嗯，她找到了一个方法，
Um, and she knew she she figured out a way,
因为我们有中国
you know, because we had Chinese
厨师和会说英语的青少年。
cooks and we had English-speaking teenagers.
所以她找到了一个方法让这
So she figured out a way for those
两种不同的人能够沟通。
those two different people to communicate.
她创造了一整套代码系统，
She made a whole like code system
让双方都能理解。
that both sides could understand.
总之，嗯，他们，嗯，
Anyway, um, they they they, um,
她解决了问题，
she she she worked it out and
我们得以将生意做大，
we were able to build the business up for
但这花了大约三年的时间。
but it took about three years to get there.
原本预计六个月，结果
It was supposed to last six months, it
花了三年。
took three years.
哇。
Wow.
我妻子去了护理学校，
My wife went to nursing school,
而我在离开餐厅后，
and then I kind of floundered in my life
生活中有些迷茫。
after I finally got out of the restaurant.
我当时想，
I was like,
你那时多大？
How old were you at that time?
嗯，大概三十出头。
Uh, probably early 30s.
哦，哇。
Oh, wow.
也许31岁。
31, maybe.
你一定很聪明。
You've got to be a smart man.
为什么？
Why?
因为你在三十出头才涉足
Because you got involved in the attorney
律师行业，还能轻松成功。
world when you were in early 30s
嗯，我不会说那是轻松的。
and still made it quite easily.
这是一场奋斗，
Well, I wouldn't say it was easy.
这是一场战斗，
It it was a fight
因为我必须完全改变
because I was to I had to totally shift
我的方向。
my direction.
我本来打算教书，
I've been, I was going to teach.
然后我不得不，嗯，
And then I had to, um,
在父亲的建议下，
on the advice of my dad,
当时经济正在下滑，
the economy was going down, it was
大约是2007、2008年。
about 2007, 2008.
嗯，经济正在下滑。
And, uh, the economy was going down.
所以很多教会都不招聘。
So a lot of churches were not hiring.
我本可以去外州，
I could have, you know, gone out of state,
但如果我那样做，就得
but if I would have done that, I would
离开我的妻子，
have had to leave my wife
我们会分开，
and we'd have been separated,
所以我不想那样做。
so I didn't want to do that.
于是我在银行找到了一份工作。
So I got a job, like at a bank.
他们对我很好，
And they were very good to me,
但你知道，那工作很无聊。
but, you know, it was pretty boring.
嗯，然后我有一些其他
Um, and then I I had some other
事奉的机会，
opportunities in ministry
但都没有实现。
that didn't come through.
嗯，所以在父亲的建议下，
And, um, so on the advice
我去了法学院。
of my dad, I went to law school.
哇。
Wow.
我去法学院躲避经济危机。
And I went and I hid from the economy
在法学院待了多久？
in law school.
嗯，刚过两年
How long did it take you?
就完成了法学院的学业。
Uh, just over two years
我是说，我，
to get through law school.
你知道，我年纪稍大，
I mean, I was, you
有点经验，
know, I was a little bit older,
所以我想，我得赶快完成这件事。
so I was like, I got to get this done.
然后，嗯，我就一直努力，努力，再努力。
And, um, so I just worked, worked, worked.
不过我自然而然地被吸引
And but I naturally gravitated
到我现在做的事情上
towards what I do today
因为我妻子家族发生的事情
because of all the stuff that happened
对我有很大的影响。
with my wife's family.
所以这就是为什么我专注于遗产规划。
So that's why I focused on estate planning.
而且我年纪稍大一些。
And I was a little bit older.
我知道我想经营自己的生意。
I knew I wanted to run a business.
嗯，我不想只是
Um, I didn't want to just be a cog
大律师事务所里的一个小螺丝。
in a big law firm.
对，没错。我觉得至少
Yes, correct. I I feel like at least like
遗产规划这个行业，
the state planning, uh,
更适合你，
business is matching you,
更符合你的个性。
your personality better.
因为我无法想像
Because I I wouldn't imagine
你去做商业诉讼
you doing like business litigation
之类的事情。
or something like that.
我确实做过，但那不适合我。
And I I have done it, but it doesn't suit me.
你知道吗，
You know what,
有趣的是，这其实很像
what's interesting is it's very similar
做一名牧师。
to being a minister.
因为很多时候，坐在我位置上的人，
Because often times the people in my chair,
他们正在挣扎
they are struggling
于某种家庭危机。
with some sort of family crisis.
很多时候有人过世了，
Often times someone has passed away
他们试图接受这个事实。
and they're trying to come to terms with it.
这跟当你在教会里
It's very similar to when when
有牧师经验时很相似。
you have ministry experiences in a church.
另一件事是你经常在帮助
The other thing is you're often helping
人们做出非常困难的决定，
people to make very difficult decisions
关于对他们来说
about things that are very important to
非常重要的事情，比如生意，
them, like their business,
家庭，孩子。
their family, their kids.
这些都是，所以很多作为牧师学到的软技能
Those are all, so a lot of the soft skills
在这方面非常适用
that you learn as a minister
于律师行业。
are very applicable to to
在律师界也很适用。
the attorney world.
真不错。接下来我们谈谈政治吧。
That's nice. So next we talk about politics.
好啊。
Okay.
我觉得你是那个，嗯，
I think you're the person, uh,
让我对美国政治产生兴趣的人。
who got me interested in American politics.
真的吗？
Really?
嗯，不是兴趣，
Um, not interested,
而是让我开始更关注它。
but then like paying more attention to it.
因为在认识你之前，像美国，
Because before I met you, like American,
像是美国的政治，
like United States, the US politics,
我基本上不想参与，从不
I I basically want no part of it, never
参与，也从不花时间研究
get involved, never spend time studying
或了解正在发生的事。
or know what's going on.
所以你是那个让我
So you're the person that like
产生兴趣的人。
got me interested.
然后，嗯，我
And then, um, I
记得我们在CrossFit的时候
remember we talked about this when we were
经常聊这个。
in CrossFit a lot.
像是应该投给谁。
Like who were who were supposed to vote for.
那是在2016年选举之前。
It was, uh, right before the 2016 election.
川普的第一个任期。
Trump's first term.
对，我们聊过川普，也
Yeah, we were talking about Trump, we were
聊过希拉蕊。
talking about Hillary.
然后，嗯，有趣的是，
And then, uh, funny
有趣的部分是，我最终
part was, uh, that was I eventually
投给了希拉蕊。
voted for Hillary.
然后现在回头看，
And then nowadays, I I look back,
我有点震惊
I would I'm a little bit shocked
自己怎么会投给她。
like how I was able to vote for her.
我知道，我记得你也投了
I knew, I remember you voted
给她，对吧？
for her too because, right?
是的，我有点后悔。
I did. Yeah, and I kind of regret that.
对，我很惊讶
Yeah, I was surprised
因为现在回头看，
because, uh, right now looking back, like
我无法相信我投给了希拉蕊。
I could not believe I voted for Hillary.
但那时的国家情况不同
But it was a different time in the country
而且川普太不一样了
and Trump was so different
比任何其他政治人物
than any other politician
都要与众不同，那时我们从未体验过。
we'd ever experienced at that point.
对。
Right.
他说话直截了当。
He he was straight to the point.
嗯，是的，但他用一种方式
Well, yeah, but he would do it in a way
让很多人感到不舒服。
that made a lot of people uncomfortable.
对。
Right.
那让我也感到不舒服。
And that was it made me uncomfortable.
我在想，我真的能信任这家伙吗？
I was like, can I really trust this guy?
因为你是登记在册的
Because because you are a registered
共和党人，对吧？
Republican, right?
我是登记在册的共和党人。
I am a registered Republican.
所以对你来说，转向
So for you to, uh, pivot
然后投票给民主党人，
and then voted for a Democrat,
特别是希拉蕊，
especially in Hillary, was
对你来说是个艰难的决定。
going to be a hard decision for you.
天啊，我记得站在
Oh my gosh. I remember standing
投票箱前。
in the ballot box.
我大概在那站了五分钟。
I I probably stood there for five minutes.
我做不到，但最后
I couldn't do it. But then
我还是想，赶快完成吧。
I finally, oh, just get it done.
这有点像是在选择
It's kind of like picking like the better
较不糟的选项。
worst choice.
我不知道，就像
I don't know, like
那时我认为这是较好的
At that point, I thought it was the better
选择，因为
choice because
我
I
我不知道。
I don't know.
我当时并不了解很多，嗯，
I wasn't aware of a lot of the, um,
来自不同媒体来源的
the messaging that you get from different
讯息。
media sources at that point.
对。
Right.
但你不觉得自2016年以来，
But but don't you feel like ever since 2016,
政治变得越来越
like the politics has become
两极化了吗？
more and more polarizing?
是的。
Yes.
所以现在感觉
So right now it feels
如果你不是右派，就是
like if you're not the right, you're
左派，
the left,
如果你不是左派，就是右派。
if you're not the left, you're the right.
没有太多
There's not a lot.
中间立场，对吧？
There's no middle ground, right?
是的。
Yeah.
而我们一直，两人
And we were always, both
都站在中间立场。
of us were always very middle ground.
我们总是中立的。
We're we're always middle.
所以我觉得这对
So I I feel like that's also a bad sign for
未来来说也是个坏兆头，因为
for for for the future because
我记得让美国伟大的原因
I I remember uh what made America great
是因为
was because
他们总是愿意
um they're always willing
与对立政党合作。
to work with the opposing party.
嗯。
Mhm.
但现在，我们看不到这种情况。
But nowadays, like we just don't see it.
例如，如果民主党
Like, for example, if Democrats
推动一个对美国人民
is uh pushing a
有益的议程，
agenda that's good for the American people,
因为是民主党推动，共和党
because Democrats pushes it, Republican
的人就百分之百反对。
people just 100% deny it.
他们甚至不考虑。
Like they don't even consider it.
反之亦然，对吧？
And vice versa, right?
所以，
So,
你认为我们该如何解决这个问题？
how do you think we should fix that?
或者你认为有办法解决吗？
Or do you think there's a way to fix that?
还有你认为是怎么从
And then how you think it went from like
人们一起合作，
people working together,
即使他们的意识形态
even though their ideology
可能不完全相同，
might not be identical,
但他们仍愿意
but then they're still willing
与对立政党合作，
to work with the opposing party,
到现在变得如此分歧。
versus nowadays it's just so diverse.
是的。
Yeah.
就像，感觉左派的人
Like, it it almost feel like the left people
讨厌右派的人。
hate the right people.
右翼的人讨厌左翼。
The right people hate the left.
右翼的人不一定，但...
And right people not necessarily, but then
对，我...
Yeah, I I
我不知道。
I don't know.
呃...
Uh
我不觉得右翼的人讨厌...
I I don't feel like the right people hate
左翼的人，但...
the left people, but um
那里有很多紧张关系。
there's a lot of tension there.
对。
Right.
嗯...
Um
我觉得...
it I think
这能挽救吗？
is it salvageable?
老实说，我不确定。
I'm not sure, honestly.
越来越难了。
It's getting harder.
我不确定国会...
I'm not sure if Congress
是否真的能挽救。
is actually salvageable.
我不知道国会是否还有...
I don't know if Congress has the influence
过去的影响力。
that it did in the past.
事实上，我觉得像你这样的人...
In fact, I think people like you have
有时比国会里的人...
more influence sometimes
更有影响力。
than people in Congress.
对，就像自制媒体。
Yeah, like self-made media.
自制媒体，独立媒体，对。
Self-made media, independent media, yes.
既然我们谈到这个...
So, since we talk about this,
我们来谈谈查理·柯克。
we're going to talk about Charlie Kirk.
好。
Okay.
因为他是个自力更生的百万富翁...
Because um he was a uh self-made millionaire,
他的影响力...
and then his influence was
我觉得他是最具...
like the only I I I think he was the most
影响力的共和党人...
impactful Republican people to
将年轻人...
Bringing bringing
带入右翼意识形态。
Bringing younger people uh into the
然后不幸的是...
the the the right-wing ideologies.
几周前...
And then unfortunately
他被暗杀了。
he was uh assassinated a couple weeks ago.
我不知道你是否记得...
And then I don't know if you remember,
我跟你分享过一些查理...
I shared with you some of the Charlie
柯克的片段...
Kirk clips
对。
Yeah.
几年前。
a couple years ago.
很久以前，对。
a long time ago, yeah.
所以这真的让我很难受。
So this really hits me hard.
查理的死...
Like the death of Charlie
让我很难受...
Kirk hits me hard in a
从多个层面。
multiple dimensions.
首先，这是我...
First of all, like this is somebody
每天都看的人。
I watch every day.
几乎每天。
Almost every day.
我看他所有的内容...
Like I watch all his contents,
然后...
and then
我并不完全同意他...
I don't agree with him 100%,
但我尊重他的作为。
but then I respect what he does.
然后有人因为...
And then somebody just took his life because
他认为...
he thinks...
我不知道你是否知道...
So so I don't know if you know about this,
但枪手基本上认为...
but then the shooter basically thought um
查理是法西斯主义者。
Charlie was a fascist.
对。
Yeah.
这真的很可笑...
Which is really, really funny
嗯。
Mhm.
因为法西斯主义基本上是...
because a fascist is basically terminating
消灭与你意见不同的人。
whoever have a different opinion than you.
对，很讽刺。
Yeah, it's very ironic.
而这正是他所做的。
And then that's exactly what he does.
对，很讽刺，很讽刺。
Yeah, it's very ironic, ironic.
而查理完全不是这样。
And then Charlie is none of that.
嗯。
Mhm.
这对我来说...
And then this is very
非常非常非常悲伤...
very very very sad for me
因为有人能...
because somebody could
仅仅因为误解...
just take away someone else's life
就夺走别人的生命...
because he thought
认为他是某种他不是的人。
of like he's something that he isn't.
这确实很令人悲伤。
It is very saddening too.
然后嗯
And then um
我要跟你多说一点关于嗯
I'm going to tell you more about um
查理·柯克的事情，因为嗯
Charlie Kirk thing because um
在他被暗杀后，
after he was assassinated,
我真的很难过。
I was really upset.
我很生气。
I was mad.
我真的很悲伤。
I was really sad.
然后
And then
但是，但是，然后有件事让我震惊。
but but but then something shocked me.
所以当他们抓住枪手时，
So when they caught the shooter,
我其实并不
I actually didn't
我其实不希望他死。
I actually didn't want him to die.
我，我，我其实对这个人
I I I actually didn't have any
没有任何仇恨的想法。
hateful thought on this guy.
嗯。
Mhm.
我觉得
I feel like
因为，因为
because because
通常当发生这样的暗杀事件时
normally when when there's an assassination
像这样，
like this,
嗯，枪手会自杀，对吧？
um the shooter shot themselves, right?
这真的是我们能活捉
It's really a case where we can catch
一个人的罕见案例。
somebody alive.
所以我觉得我们需要找出他为什么
So I feel like we need to find out why he
会变成这样。
became this way.
嗯。
Mhm.
因为他来自一个保守的嗯家庭。
Because he's from a conservative um family.
嗯。
Mhm.
根据目前可获得的资讯
And just based on the information
现在，
available now,
说嗯他的
saying that um his
家人说他变得有点
families are saying that he got a little
更政治化
more political
在过去几年。
in the past couple years.
然后嗯我想他的男朋友
And then um I think his boyfriend
或女朋友是跨性别者，
or girlfriend is a transgender,
之类的事情。
stuff like that.
然后我想这就像
And then I think that's like
那是某件事
that's something
那是我们需要真正
that that's an issue that we need to really
关注的问题
pay our attention to
以免这种事再次发生。
so this doesn't happen again.
嗯。
Mhm.
另一件事是嗯
Another thing is um
我觉得这次嗯
I feel like this uh
暗杀让我更接近
assassination has drawn me closer to
基督教。
Christianity.
真的吗？
Really?
这很令人震惊，因为嗯
Which is shocking because uh
如你所知，我不是一个有信仰的人，对吧？
as you know, I'm not a belief guy, right?
嗯。
Mhm.
即使我们聊了很多，你，你
Even even though we talk a lot, you you
总是告诉我说
always told me like
有一天可能会有个事件
one day maybe there will be an incident
或发生了什么事
or something happened
会让我更接近信仰。
that that will draw me closer.
我觉得我现在更接近了。
I feel like I'm closer now.
嗯。
Mhm.
因为我看到
Because I saw
所以基本上我认为嗯
so so basically what I thought was uh
即使查理能复活
even if Charlie is able to revive
比如一小时，
for like an hour,
我很确定他不会后悔
I'm pretty sure he's not going to regret
任何事。
anything.
是的。
Yeah.
然后这真的，真的很震撼。
And then that's really, really powerful.
然后我不知道你有没有看过，有
And then I don't know if you have seen, have
你看过嗯
you seen um
艾莉卡·柯克？
Erica Kirk?
嗯。
Mhm.
嗯，所以他的妻子，那个演讲？
Um so his wife, like the speech?
嗯。
Mhm.
然后她基本上在全世界面前原谅了枪手
And then she basically forgave the shooter
几乎就在全世界面前
right in front of the world pretty
因为每个人都看著。
much because everybody was watching.
那真是无比的勇气。
That tremendous, tremendous courage.
所以
So
这让我更靠近基督教
that has drawn me closer to Christian
因为我觉得
because I feel like because
他们有真正的信仰。
they have that true belief.
所以死亡只是
So death is just
暂时的，或者说并不像我们
temporary or like it's not like we all we
都在这里
all here
活个七、八十、九十岁。
to live like maybe 70, 80, 90 years old.
然后就
And then it's
从整体时间来看
in terms of like
就像是
the whole time, like it's
七、八十年非常短暂。
70, 80 years is very, very short.
嗯。
Mhm.
所以，我不知道，你
So, I don't know, what
怎么看这件事？
do you think about that?
你是怎么
What were you
看待整个查理·柯克的事件？
the the the whole Charlie Kirk thing?
我的意思是，当我们在讨论时，
I mean, when we were talking,
互相发讯息
texting each other
这件事发生时，真的
when this was happening, it was
非常悲惨，非常悲惨。
extremely tragic, extremely tragic.
嗯，我也被情感上
Um I was I was also emotionally
深深影响了。
impacted by it.
我想很多人都一样。
I think a lot of people were.
我们竟然
That we have
会发生这样的事
something like this happen
在美国
in the United States of America
真是难以置信。
is just unbelievable.
对吧。
Right.
嗯
Um
而且你知道，他基本上
and you know, he's basically
这真的很有趣
it's so interesting
因为他基本上在做的事
because he was basically doing something
是美国所谓代表的价值。
that America supposedly stands for.
你可以表达你的意见。
You can just you can share your opinion.
对。
Yeah.
然后
And
嗯，但他被枪杀了。
um and it he was gunned down.
这真是件可怕的事。
So it was an awful thing.
而且你知道，他有
And you know, he's got he's
孩子，有妻子。
got kids, he's got a wife.
他是个活生生的人。
He's a person.
也许这就是，你知道，
Maybe that is, you know,
回到你刚才说的，
kind of going back to what you said,
我们必须想到对立的人
we have to think about that there somebody
也是一个活生生的人。
who's opposing you is a person.
他们有家庭，
They come from a family,
有自己的生活。
they come from a life.
所以倾听的重要性
So there's an importance of listening
在于听别人说话，
to someone,
即使你不同意他们。
even if you disagree with them.
而且倾听
And and what listening
不仅仅是
means is not just like
当他们跟你说话时，
when they're talking to you,
哦，我接下来要说什么？
oh, what am I going to say next?
而是
But rather
我如何真正理解这个人？
how can I really understand this person?
我如何真正理解
How can I really understand
他们的生活和他们的
their life and their and what they're
想法？
about?
嗯
The um
查理，
Charlie,
当然，我完全不了解他。
of course, I have no idea.
我也只是从影片中认识他
I I only knew him from the videos
所以我不认识这个人。
too, so I don't know the man.
我不认识他的妻子或任何事。
I don't know his wife or anything.
嗯
Um
但是
but
我认为他们真的很好
I think that they are really good
我的意思是，他并不完美。
I mean, he's not perfect.
我确定有影片
I'm sure there's a video
可以显示
out there that you can
他在某个地方做了些什么，你知道，
show where he's done something, you know,
说错了话。
Say the wrong thing.
说错了话，但是
Said the wrong thing, but
天啊，他真的很勇敢。
my golly, he was out there.
是的。
Yeah.
他在外面，他在外面而且
He was out he was out there and and
与人讨论这些想法，
and kind of wrestling with these ideas
这种事确实会发生。
with people and you know, that happens.
但他的勇气，我的意思是，他说过
But the courage, I mean, he said that it
我不知道是不是他说的，但我
I I don't know if he said it, but I I
感觉我听过他
feel like I've heard him
说过一些话，
say things where
他所做的事很重要，
the things that that he was doing mattered
重要到甚至
to the point where um
天啊，他为此献出了生命。
gosh, he gave his life for it.
是的。
Yeah.
然后，我的意思是，在某种程度上，如果
And then I mean, in a way, if
他是耶稣的追随者，
he is a follower of Jesus
那他就在走这条路。
that he is kind of following that path.
嗯
Um
你知道，耶稣
you know, Jesus
自己也为他人献出了生命。
himself gave up his life for other people.
是的。
Yeah.
嗯，但是
Um but
很有趣的是
it's interesting
因为你有两面，
because you have kind of two sides
同一枚硬币的两面，
of the same coin
关于查理和艾莉卡。
with both Charlie and Erica.
你有这个
You have the the
献出生命的人，
person who gave up his life,
然后还有宽恕的一面，
and then you also have the forgiveness
在她身上，
side with her
是的。
Yeah.
嗯，她
where um she
我相信她仍在挣扎。
and I'm sure she's still wrestling with it.
你知道，宽恕就像是
You know, forgiveness is like a it's
像波浪一样，对吧？
like waves, right?
这仍然让我感到痛苦。
It's still even hurting me.
每天都让我感到痛苦。
Like it's still hurting me every day.
是的。
Yeah.
就像我醒来时，觉得天啊，
Like I I woke up, I just like, oh my god,
查理已经不在了。
Charlie's no longer with us.
是的。
Yeah.
而我只是他的观众。
And I'm just his viewer.
我从未见过他。
I never met the guy.
我几乎看过他所有的影片，
I saw almost all his videos,
但我感觉他像是
but then I feel like he's somebody that
我认识的人。
I know.
在某种程度上，对吧？
In a way, right?
因为你已经看过
Because you've you've kind of seen
他对很多事情的想法，
uh so much about what he thinks
对吧？
about things, right?
对。
Right.
这会让人感到一点失落。
And and that causes a little bit of a loss.
然后另一个有趣的部分是
And then another funny part is that
你记得乔治·佛洛伊德，对吧？
you you you remember uh George Floyd, right?
嗯。
Mhm.
这是确定的
Which is a confirmed
多项重罪记录。
felony, multiple counts.
然后当他被杀时，显然，
And then when when he got killed, obviously,
我不是说
I'm not saying like
警方没有
the the police has is
对他的死负部分责任。
not not responsible for for
但问题是
part of his death.
人们事后的反应。
But then the problem is how people react
是的。
afterwards.
对。
Yeah.
所以乔治·佛洛伊德是
So George Floyd is somebody
一个有多次重罪记录的人，
who had multiple counts of felonies
还是个毒瘾者。
and then drug addicts.
这些都是确定的资讯。
Those are confirmed information.
当像这样的人去世时，
And when somebody like like
然后发生了什么？
that died, and then what happened?
到处都是暴动。
Um there's riot everywhere.
有人闯入商店，
There's people breaking into the stores,
是的。
Yeah.
尤其是在洛杉矶地区。
especially in the Los Angeles area.
是的。
Yeah.
那时候真是疯狂的时期。
It was a crazy time back then.
人们甚至封锁了高速公路。
People were blocking the freeway.
然后
And then
在我看来，查理·柯克
in my opinion, Charlie Kirk is
比乔治·佛洛伊德强大千倍
a thousand times more of a man
作为一个男人。
than George Floyd.
然后他被残忍地暗杀了。
And then he was brutally assassinated.
而一些左派的人，
And then some of the people on the left,
他们竟然为此庆祝。
they celebrated it.
讽刺的是，
And then the the the the ironic part is that
右派的人却没有暴动。
people on the right, there's no riot.
什么都没有。
There's nothing.
是的。
Yeah.
这真的是截然不同。
It is it is starkly different.
是的。
Yeah.
我真的希望每个人都能看到
And I I really hope everybody can see
你想要生活在什么样的世界。
like which part of the world you want.
一个罪犯被杀，
A criminal gets killed and
然后人们开始暴动。
then people started a riot.
所以左派的人制造了混乱。
So the left people they they created a mess.
而当查理被暗杀时，
And then when Charlie got assassinated,
大家只是默默哀悼，
everybody just mourn
和平地悼念。
silently, peacefully.
我想问题是，
I I I guess the question is like
你想要生活在
what type of world
什么样的世界，对吧？
you want to live in, right?
是的。
Yeah.
尤其是
And then especially
过去十年，我觉得
the past 10 years, I feel like the
「觉醒病毒」已经
the woke virus have
完全占领了这个世界，
completely taken over this world
而且越来越疯狂。
and it's getting crazy.
嗯
Um
确实，有很多人
there are yeah, there's a lot of people
他们
who um
其实这真的很有趣，
who are are
他们只是
actually it's really interesting,
表达自己真正的想法
are just kind of voicing
关于这些事情。
what they really think
是的。
Yeah.
关于这些事。
about things.
对。
Right.
而以前，
And whereas before,
大概在2016、2017年，
maybe like in 2016, 2017,
当我们谈论这些事情时，
when we used to talk about these things,
你会把它藏在心里，
you kind of keep it to yourself
除非你身处
unless you were in
一个你可以放心分享
company that you were okay with
你真实想法的环境。
sharing what you really thought about things.
谈到乔治·佛洛伊德，
Um talking about George Floyd,
我认为重要的是要意识到
I think it's important to realize
那里有很多痛苦
that there's a lot of pain there
是人们长久以来经历的。
that people have experienced
有些人会利用这一点，
over a long time.
比如抢劫之类的，
Um some people will take advantage of that,
你知道的。
you know, with like the looting
对。
and everything.
对。
Right.
但对其他人来说，这真的
But other people, it it really hits them
深深触动了他们，
um to their core
因为即使，
uh because even though, you know,
也许事实不是完美的，
maybe it's not the perfect um
你可以这么说，
set of facts, you could say,
他们仍然
they're they're still
仍有痛苦
there's still pain
在其中表现出来。
that is illustrated in it.
这值得倾听，
And that's worth listening to
因为这会给你一个不同的
um because that will give you a different
视角，
perspective
或者至少软化你的看法。
or at least maybe soften your perspective.
对。
Right.
是的。
Yeah.
所以，我想问题是
So so I guess the question is
像现在，2025年，
like nowadays, 2025,
你认为政治
do you think politics
真的能改变人们的生活吗？
can really change people's life?
像是政治
Like can you can politics
真的有效吗？
actually be effective?
像是选举
Like electing
A总统还是B总统？
President A versus President B?
这真的有差别吗？
Like does it really make a difference?
你认为
Do you do you think this
我们能通过选举
do you think we can make it a better world
更好的领导者
by by electing a
让世界变得更好吗？
a better leaders?
成功的机会有多大？
What are the chances of that?
你怎么看？
What do you think?
我认为可以。
I I think yes.
我认为政策，一般的政策
I think that policies, general policies
会影响人们的生活。
can impact people's lives.
而且我认为最重要的是
And I think that more than anything else
我们看到
we see
政治言论
is that political rhetoric
以及他们说的事情
and the things that they say
也对人们的生活
also has a tremendous
有巨大的影响。
impact on people's lives.
所以很多被说的事情
So a lot of the things that um are said
无论是关于右派还是左派，
either about the right or the left,
我认为主要是
I think it's mostly
左派在说这些话。
the left is saying these things.
老实说，现实一点吧。
I mean, if you're realistic, come on.
是的。
Yeah.
他们所说的
The the things that they're saying about
关于那些想法不同的人，
people who kind of think differently
关于他们，
about them,
嗯，他们
uh they um
这会影响人们的生活。
that can impact people's lives.
这影响了查理的生活
It impacted Charlie's life
和他的家人。
and his family.
嗯，但我认为这也
Um but I I think that it also it
它的作用是
what it does is that
当政治言论
when you when you go too far
走得太远时，
on the political rhetoric,
会导致一些处于边缘的人
it causes people who are maybe on the fringe
或感到不被接受的人，嗯
or who don't feel accepted, um
或试图在生活中寻求意义的人
or who are trying to have significance
在他们的生活中，
in their in their life,
最终做出了一些
they end up doing things that
非常非常糟糕的决定。
just make very, very poor decisions.
就像事实上
Like the fact that that
当那个孩子爬上屋顶时，
when that kid got up on that rooftop,
他有很多机会
he had many points
可以问自己，我在做什么？
where he could have said, what am I doing?
是的。
Yeah.
但他还是扣下了扳机。
But he he's still pulled the trigger.
他还是，嗯，他本可以停下来，
He's still, well, he could have stopped,
他本可以在那个
he could have stopped when he that
早上说，
morning and said,
也许我不该这么做。
I maybe I shouldn't do this.
或者当他走向大楼时，
Or like when he's walking to the building,
或者当他走上楼梯
or when he walks up the stairs
到大楼时，
to the building,
或者当他坐下来，他
or when he sits down, he's
躺在那里，他望著
laying there, he's looking out
瞄准镜，
through the scope,
他本可以停下来。
he could have stopped.
有多个
There's multiple
他本可以倾听的时刻
points where he could have listened to
有趣的是
it's interesting the
圣经提到上帝的声音
scriptures talk about the voice of God
与之相对的是
versus the voice
你自己的声音，或罪恶的声音
of yourself, of of of yourself or of sin
甚至是邪恶的声音。
or even of evil.
嗯哼。
Mhm.
而且有多个
And there's multiple
在我们的生活中有许多时刻
points in all of our lives
我们会遇到这些事情
where we have those things
必须做出这些决定，
and we have to make those decisions,
我要听从哪个声音？
which voice am I going to listen to?
我要相信哪个声音？
Which voice am I going to trust?
有趣的是，嗯
And the funny part was that um
你知道他说
you know he said that
他自首的唯一原因是
the only reason he he turned himself in
他不希望特警队
was because he didn't want the SWAT
闯进他家并开枪射击他。
team to break in his house and shoot him.
我知道。
I know.
这太疯狂了。
That's crazy.
这正是他刚刚做的事。
Which is exactly what he just did.
是啊。
Yeah.
这真是令人悲伤。
It's it's so sad.
那么让我分享一下我的想法。
So so so let me share you what I think.
所以
So
嗯，因为现在我有相当多的
um because right now I have a pretty
观众群
big audience
很多人其实会问，嘿，Derek，
and a lot of people actually ask, hey Derek,
你为什么不做点什么，
why don't you do something,
谈谈政治？
talk politically?
呃，我认为我不太能
Uh what I believe is I I don't think um
通过从事政治做太多事
I can do as much running politics
比起帮助人们赚钱。
than helping people make money.
因为我觉得帮助
Because I feel like helping
人们赚钱
people make money
可以显著改变世界。
can significantly change the world.
这就是我的信念。
That that's what I believe.
哦，这很有趣。
Oh, that's interesting.
是的，所以很明显
Yeah, so so obviously
你认识我超过十年了
you knew me for over a decade
之前我从未投资。
before I never invest.
在金钱方面，我基本上毫无头绪。
In terms of money, I have basically no idea.
我知道如何赚钱，
I knew how to make money,
但我从不知道如何管理金钱
but then I never knew how to manage money
或如何投资金钱
or how to invest money
以及如何让金钱自己
and how to let money makes
赚更多的钱，对吧？
more money by itself, right?
所以我学到了，嗯
So I learned that um
那是在我34岁时，大约五年前。
when I was 34, so about five years ago.
然后在过去五年，我
And then in the past five years, I
我的净资产增长了40倍。
I 40x my net worth in the past five years.
然后我看到了巨大的影响。
And then I I I saw a great impact.
因为我相信...
And then because because I I believe...
你是从哪些方面看到了影响？
In what way have you seen the impact?
基本上，嗯，我觉得当你
So basically, um I feel like when you
在财务上更舒适时
when you're more comfortable
财务上更宽裕，
in terms of financially more comfortable,
你有机会去发展，
you you have the opportunity to develop,
让自己成为更好的人。
to make you a better person.
比方说，如果有人
So let's say if somebody
只赚最低工资，
who's making minimum wage,
在支付食物上有困难，
who are having problem uh
支付房租有困难，
paying for their food,
支付房租有困难，
paying for their rent,
你不会指望这个人花额外的
you don't expect the person to spend extra
努力
effort
去思考如何成为更好的人。
on how to become a better person.
所以我相信，嗯
So I believe like having um
财务上更舒适
being more comfortable financially
有助于你发展
helps you develop
你的智慧。
your wisdom.
因为你有奢侈的时间去做。
Because you have the luxury to do it.
你是说你终于
You mean you finally
有时间来提升自己？
have the time to work on yourself?
对。
Right.
显然我们不是说100%，对吧？
Obviously we're not saying 100%, right?
大多数人仍然会
Most people are still going to
追逐金钱。
chase for the dollar.
当他们赚到10万，他们会
When they make 100 grand, they're
追求一年100万，
going to go for a million a year,
他们会追求一年1000万。
they're going to go for 10 million a year.
大多数人还是这样。
Most people are still like that.
但我相信
But I I believe
当你在财务上越来越宽裕时，
like as you get more comfortable financially,
你会有机会
you get an opportunity
让自己成为更好的人，
to make yourself a better person,
增长你的智慧。
to grow your wisdom.
好吧。
Okay.
这给了你这样的机会。
It give you that chance.
但如果你只是勉强
But then if you're just making
维持日常开支，
if you're just barely
那真的很难
flying by with your daily expense,
专注于自我发展。
it's really hard to
很难把心思放在自我提升上。
to focus on self-development.
嗯，我不确定我是否同意，但
Uh yeah, I'm not sure I agree, but
我想我明白你的
I I think I understand what you're
这很像马斯洛的需求层次理论。
It's very Maslow's hierarchy of needs.
你熟悉这个理论吗？
Are you familiar with that?
是的，是的。
Yes, yes, yes.
所以基本上，
So so basically, um
因为我们都住在美国，对吧？
because we all live in America, right?
生活在这个国家
And then it's a blast to be living
真是太棒了，
in this country
因为大多数人，即使你拿最低工资，
because most of people, even you are minimum
最低工资，
wage,
你还是能过得去，
you still can get by your your life
对吧，比较轻松？
fairly easily, right?
如果你努力工作的话。
If you work hard.
如果你不住在加州，是的。
And if you don't live in California, yeah.
对，对。
Right, right.
但在台湾，
So so but but in Taiwan,
很多人
a lot of people like
几乎是不可能的，
it's it's it's a it's almost impossible
对一个劳工来说，
for a labor
如果你为别人工作，
if you're working for somebody,
几乎不可能
it's almost impossible
买得起房子。
for you to buy a house.
哦，真的吗？
Oh, really?
这真的成为一个大问题。
It's really it's becoming a huge problem.
我想在亚洲也是。
I think over Asia too.
所以为了解决这个问题，你必须
So in order to fix that problem, you kind
增加你的收入。
of have to uh increase your income.
工资必须跟上。
Wages have to catch up.
是的。
Yes.
所以这就是
So so that that's
我正在做的事，因为我相信
what I'm doing because I believe uh
帮助更多人
helping more people
赚更多钱，帮助
making more money, helping
更多人在财务上更宽裕
more people be more comfortable
可以让世界变得更美好。
can make the world a better place.
因为他们会有更多机会
Because then they'll have more opportunity
能够专注于自我提升，
to be able to work on themselves
因为他们不用
because they don't
担心这些基本需求。
have to worry about these needs.
正确。
Correct.
显然这不会是百分之百。
Obviously it's not going to be 100%.
可能只有10%，可能只有5%。
It might be 10%, it might be 5%.
但如果我们有5%或10%
But then if we if you have like 5 or 10%
的总人口
of the total population
开始思考
to start thinking
如何成为更好的人，
more about how to becoming a better person,
世界会变得更美好。
the world would be a better place.
好吧，我有一个稍微
Okay, I have a slightly
不同的观点。
different perspective.
和我分享吧。
Share with me.
当我是一名牧师时，
So when I was a minister,
我每个月大概赚800美元。
um I made about $800 a month.
哦，那真的很少。
Oh, that's very little.
非常少。
Very little.
我甚至没有足够的钱
I didn't even have enough to make
支付医疗保险。
to pay for health insurance.
哇。
Wow.
后来教会帮我付了
Later on the church paid
医疗保险费用，
for my health insurance,
他们真是太好了。
which was very kind of them.
但我记得我失去了什么
Um but I remember that I lost um
我的车坏了
my car broke down
我没有钱去
and I didn't have money to uh
买一辆新车。
pay for a new car.
但我还是得去教堂，因为
So but I had to still go to church because
你知道，
I was, you know,
我要主持礼拜和其他事务。
doing services and everything.
所以我开始骑脚踏车去教堂。
So I started riding my bike to church.
大约六英里。
It was about six miles.
好的。
Okay.
去教堂六英里，回来六英里。
Six miles to church and six miles back.
但你知道，密苏里州会下雨，
But you know, it rains in Missouri,
所以有时我得冒雨骑车。
so sometimes I have to ride through the rain.
我只能带著
I just have to carry
衣服和其他东西放在包里。
my clothes and everything inside my bag.
哇。
Wow.
嗯
Um
但有一件有趣的事情
but one of the interesting things
当你这样挣扎时，
when you are struggling like that,
你也真的学会如何信靠上帝。
you also really learn how to trust God.
好的。
Okay.
这和你说的方式
Which which is a little bit different
有点不同，对吧？
way you're saying, right?
你说必须先解决
Where you're saying like you got to got
基本的东西，
to take care of the the the basic things
然后才有时间
and then you finally
专注于这些事情，
have time to focus on these things
像是自我发展之类的。
that are more like self-development or
或其他。
whatever.
但我认为那些时候正是
But I think that those are the times when
我跟你讲个故事吧。
because I'll I'll tell you a story.
你可以听听看，随你。
You can take it or leave it, whatever.
好的。
Okay.
我真的厌倦了骑脚踏车
Um I was so tired of riding
去教堂，
my bike to church
所以我祷告说，上帝，我需要6000美元
that I was I prayed, God, I need $6,000
来买一辆车。
to buy a car.
那是
That was
哦，哇。
Oh wow.
6000美元可以让我买到一辆
6,000 was going to get me something that
能用的车，
was going to work,
一辆不会让我
that was going to be
老是担心要送修的车。
I wasn't going to have to really worry about
不用常去修理厂。
taking to the shop and everything.
所以我祷告了。
And so I I prayed.
然后教堂里来了一位女士。
And then this lady came from the church.
她不知道，她看到我骑脚踏车。
She didn't know, she saw me ride my bike.
她可能同情我。
She's probably pitying me.
但是
But
她说上帝对她说话，
she she said that that God had spoke to her
上帝希望她
and that God wanted to
把她的车给我。
for her to give me her car.
哦，哇。
Oh wow.
于是她最终把车给了我，
And so she ended up giving her car to me
那辆车的价值，
and the value of that car,
我让你猜猜是多少。
I'll let you guess how much it was.
那辆车的价值是6000美元。
It was valued at $6,000.
哇。
Wow.
那次经历，
That experience,
让我更靠近上帝，
it drew me closer to God
即使我很穷。
even though I was poor.
我认为那是
And I think that that
生活的日常挣扎，
it's the daily struggles
你其实可以
of life that you can actually
增进与上帝的关系，
grow in your relationship
也在与人的关系中成长，
with God and grow in your relationship
甚至可能
with being
就像你说的，
even maybe what
只是变成一个更好的人之类的。
you're saying is maybe just kind of becoming
或诸如此类。
a better person or whatever.
你知道，从基督教的
Um you know, from a Christian
角度来看，我们有不同的
perspective, we come from a different
一点观点，
bit of perspective
我们依靠
where we depend upon
上帝来改变我们
God to change us
而是依靠上帝来改变我们。
rather than trying to change ourselves.
好。
Okay.
嗯，但是
Um but
但那改变了我。
But that that changed me.
也让我和那位女士的关系
And it also my relationship with this lady
变得非常非常正面。
also became very, very positive
因为她为我所做的事。
because of what she had done for me.
所以很多美好的事情发生了
So a lots of wonderful things happened
从那次经历中，
out of that experience,
即使我很穷。
even though I was poor.
哇。
Wow.
那是个很震撼的故事。
That's that's a powerful story.
是的。
Yeah.
所以我觉得不管怎样，无论是
So I feel like either way, like whether
你刚刚提到的观点
it's whatever you just presented
还是我的信念，
or whatever I believe,
我认为这些都是为了
I think they're all for the
我不知道，只是觉得这些观点
I don't know, just I think the perspective
是
is
都很不错。
is both good.
对吧？
Right?
所以，我想当我们
So, I guess when we
谈到生活成本之类的话题时，
talk about like cost of living and stuff,
我们来聊聊
so we talk let's talk about
一些更轻松的话题吧。
like something more relaxed.
我们来谈谈
Let's talk about like
洛杉矶的生活成本。
cost of living in Los Angeles.
好。
Okay.
天啊。你觉得如何？
Oh my god. Why do you think?
你有两个孩子，对吧？
So you have two kids, right?
一家四口。
A family of four.
对，一家四口。
Yes. Family of four.
那么，你觉得像这样的家庭，
So, what do you think is like, so
假设住在尔湾，
let's say living in Irvine.
你觉得需要
What do you think is a
多少收入才能
like how much you think is needed
一家四口过得舒适？
per household of four?
天啊。
Oh my gosh.
为了过得舒适。
In order to live comfortably.
我问这个问题的原因是
The reason why I ask is because
很多人认为，在美国生活，
a lot of people think, uh, living in America,
有份好工作，比如
like having a good job, like
你是律师，
you're an attorney
而安娜显然是护士。
and then, um, obviously Anna is a nurse.
很多人认为，哦，
A lot of people think, oh,
像你们这样的家庭
a family like you guys
应该过得很舒适。
should live very comfortably.
然后你可以分享你的故事，
And then you can share your story and and
告诉我们的观众这是否属实。
tell our audience if it's true.
我觉得真的很难。
I think it's really, really hard.
我认为
I think that the the
在加州你必须赚到
amount that you have to make
一定的金额才能
in California in order to
如果你想买房子，
if you want to buy a house,
大概需要年收入40万或50万美元吧。
it's probably $4 or $500,000, I feel like.
家庭收入。
Household income.
家庭收入。好。
Household income. Okay.
是的。
Yeah.
这非常困难，因为即使是这个金额，
That's very tough cuz even that,
我觉得你还是会很吃紧。
I feel like you're you're you're strapped.
因为税负很重。
Cuz you're getting taxed heavily.
是的。
Yes.
在这个税级。而且还有房产税和
In that bracket. And property tax and
如果你买房子，
and if you if you buy a house for,
你知道，只是
you know, just a
我从堪萨斯城地区搬到这里时
I was so shocked when I moved
对房价感到非常震惊，
from like Kansas City area to here
而且你走进去，房子有地基问题，
and the cost of the house and you know,
墙上有洞之类的，
you walk around, it's got foundation issues
还有各种问题，
and it's got holes in the wall
一切都很夸张。
and everything.
价格高得离谱。
It's it's astronomical.
对。
Right.
但是
But
我、我
I I
我是说，我们不得不，
I mean, we we've had to,
我太太在财务方面很厉害。
my wife is very good at finances.
嗯，
Um,
她几乎把这当成她的
she it's almost like become her
像是她的游戏，看她能
it's like her game on how she can
如何省下最多的钱或找到方法
uh save the most money or find ways to
让我们的钱发挥更大的作用，
make our money do more than what it
超出我原本的想像。
I thought it could.
嗯，
Um,
所以她找到了让一切运作的方法，
so she's figured out ways to make it work,
但我觉得这真的很难。
but I think it's really hard.
我不确定是否回答了你的问题。
I'm not sure if I'm answering your question.
对。所以基本上是，嗯，
Right. So so basically is um,
我刚和我最好的一个
so I just spoke to one of my best
高中朋友聊过。
friends, um, from high school.
然后
And then
他的家庭收入大约是30万。
his household income was like 300.
然后他也有两个孩子。
And then he he also had two kids.
基本上是收支平衡。
It's basically break even.
是的，我能相信。
Yeah, I could believe that.
收支平衡，对吧？然后
Break even, right? And then
他是租房还是买了房子？
Is he renting or did he buy a house?
呃，他有房贷，
Uh, he has a mortgage,
但房贷金额比较低。
but then mortgage is kind of low.
哦，他怎么做到的？
Oh, how did he do that?
嗯，他付了较多的头期款。
Um, he paid more down payments.
好吧。
Okay.
他得到了父母的帮助之类的。
He got assistance from parents and stuff.
但即使对他来说，也
But then even for him, it's
有些困难。
kind of difficult.
所以，如果有任何意外，
So, if there's any kind of accident,
比如挡风玻璃坏了
meaning if there's a broken windshield
或者轮胎爆了。
or like a flat tire.
这种事总会发生。
That's going to happen.
是的。
Yeah.
然后基本上
And then it it basically
那个月就入不敷出了，对吧？
that month is negative, right?
是的。
Yeah.
所以真的很困难。
So it's very difficult.
但然后
But then
根据统计，
statistically,
你说的像是40万、50万，对吧？
you you're saying like 400, 500,000, right?
那已经是前15%的收入了。
That's like a top 15% income.
是的。
Yeah.
所以你不觉得这是个大问题吗？
So don't you think that's a huge problem?
是的，我觉得这是个大问题。
Yeah, I think it's a huge problem.
我觉得我们都应该搬到别的地方。
I think we should all move to somewhere.
这就是为什么很多人
That's why all these people
都搬离加州，
are moving out of California
因为我们负担不起住在这里。
because we can't afford to live here.
这有点疯狂，因为就像
It's it's kind of crazy because like
明显在这个节目中，
like obviously seeing this show,
所有的来宾都像是
all the all the guests are like
过得还不错，
pretty pretty well,
自己过得挺好的。
doing pretty well for themselves.
然后就像
And then like
多位来宾都提到
multiple guests have talked about
在加州生活有多困难。
how hard it is to live in California.
是的。
Yeah.
即使有前10%、前15%的收入，
Like with a top 10, top 10, 15% income,
你还是
you're still
我不会说是挣扎，
I wouldn't I wouldn't say struggling.
我会说是过得舒适，但如果
I would say it's comfortable, but then
有任何事情发生，
if anything happen,
就变成问题了。
it becomes a problem.
我想问你的是，
I want to ask you is that,
有没有办法解决这个问题？
is there a way to fix this?
因为这基本上
Cuz it's the same
在所有已开发国家
pretty much the same thing
几乎都是一样的，
in all developed country,
像是好城市。
like good cities.
比如在台北，在上海，
Like in Taipei, in Shanghai,
在亚洲所有好的城市，
in like all the good cities in, uh, Asia,
他们基本上都面临同样的问题。
they're basically having the same problem.
所以年轻人几乎没有办法
So younger people, there's no way
以劳工阶级的身分买房子。
they can buy houses as working class.
这在美国以前从未发生过。
Which was never the case for America before.
因为我记得25、30年前，
Cuz I remember like 25, 30 years ago,
如果你是蓝领工人
if you're like a blue collar
或普通员工，
employee, worker,
你可以过得很舒服。
you can live pretty comfortably.
你可以买房子，
You can buy houses,
可以开一辆不错的车，
you can drive a pretty nice car,
而且不需要太担心。
and then you don't have to worry
不需要过多烦恼。
too much about it.
但过去30年，
And then in the past 30 years,
我觉得富人变得更富，
I feel like the rich got richer
而中产阶级却变得更穷。
and then the middle class got poorer.
这个问题越来越严重，
And then this problem is becoming
而且越来越明显。
more and more serious.
差异也越来越大。
And it's getting more and more diverse.
我觉得在未来10年，
I feel like in the next next 10 years,
富人会变得更富，
richer is going to get like rich
甚至更加富有。
going to get even richer.
而中产阶级将逐渐消失，
And then there's not going to be middle
不再存在。
class around.
只会有极端富有的人
There's only going to be like the Uber
和底层人士。
rich people
然后这是一个我不知道是否
and the entry level people.
能解决的问题。
And then it's a I don't know if it's
我不知道能否解决。
a problem that we can fix.
显然，我现在做的就像是
Obviously what I'm doing, like I'm
鼓励人们去创业，
like encouraging people to, uh,
探索机会，而不是
have a business, to explore opportunities
只为别人打工，
and instead of like just working for somebody
这可能会有帮助。
could can potentially help.
但仍然很困难。
But then it's still difficult.
我不知道如何解决。
I don't know how you fix it.
是的，我不确定我是经济学家
Yeah, I'm not sure I'm the the the economist
能解决这个问题。
to to be able to figure it out.
我的意思是，我认为必须
I mean, I think that there has to be
从不同层面来解决。
probably attacking it at different levels.
我认为现在政府有很多
Um, I think that there's a lot of government
浪费和腐败。
waste right now and corruption.
对。
Right.
以及我们花钱的方式。
And the way that we spend money.
在加州，我们税负很重。
I mean, in California, we are taxed so much.
是的。
Yeah.
为什么我们没有钱去
And why don't we have money to
支付这些事情？
pay for some of these things?
你不觉得我们每年
Don't you don't you feel like we're paying
缴的税越来越多吗？
more and more taxes every year?
哦，每次都是这样，
Oh, every all and and it's always
但债务也在不断增加。
But then the debt is also growing.
是的，债务总是在增长，
Yeah, the debt is always growing and
而且总是同样的故事，
it's always the same story
就是对富人加税，
that let's tax the rich and
从他们身上榨取更多。
um, squeeze it more and more out of them.
嗯，好吧，我想说，
Um, okay. I I mean, I guess you
假设你真的这样做了。
let's say that you did do that.
但也让我们试著更好
But let's also try to better
地使用我们拥有的资金，
use the money that we have
而不是只花在
instead of just spending
特殊利益和其他事情上。
it on special interests and everything else.
这是个支出问题。
It's a spending problem.
嗯，是腐败问题。
Well, it's a corruption problem.
腐败和支出的问题。
Corruption and spending problem.
我觉得美国债务绝对是
I feel like the US debt is definitely 100% a
支出问题。
spending problem.
如果不削减支出，
If we don't cut the spending,
不管征收多少税，
no matter how much tax more tax you get,
你只会花得更多。
you're just going to spend more.
是的。
Yeah.
对吧？就像是
Right? Like rather
支持一场
it's supporting like
我们不该参与的战争。
a war that we shouldn't be involved in.
是的。
Yeah.
或者像什么事都要插手，
Or like get involved in everything,
全球主义者。
globalist.
那是事实。我是说，这是
That's that's true. I mean, that's an
美国的政策。
American policy.
我们喜欢什么事都插一脚，
We we like to we like to have our hand
参与一切。
in everything.
所以我认为这是
So so I think there's a the the
解决问题的唯一方法
the only way to fix it
对于像你我这样的普通人，
for the average Joe, like you and me,
像我们所有的观众这样的普通人，
like regular people like all our audiences,
我认为是投资。
I believe is investing.
我认为每个人都
I believe like everybody
应该更重视投资，
should value investing more
因为大多数人他们只是
because, uh, most people they just have
他们是
they're they're
对投资一无所知。
clueless in terms of investing.
或者他们认为这像赌场。
Or they think it's a casino.
他们认为这是，你
They think it's, you
知道的，只要用正确的方式做就行。
know, you just have to do it the right way.
所以关于投资，
So in terms of investing,
我想谈谈
I want to talk about
首先，让我们谈谈房地产。
first off, let's talk about real estate.
因为我知道，你是
Cuz I know, uh, you are you are
和我同一阵营的，
in the same camp of me,
就是租房，对吧？
which is renting, right?
嗯，我记得你告诉过我这件事
Um, I remember you told me about this
大概十年前吧，当时我还年轻，
like 10 years ago maybe when I was younger,
然后我不太理解
and then I didn't really quite get it
因为那时我在财务上不太精明
cuz I was not as savvy financially
在那时。
back then.
然后你告诉
And then you were telling
我你觉得买房子
me that you feel like buying a house
不是个好主意，像是
is not a good idea, like
租房可能更好。
renting is probably better.
嗯，在加州。
Well, in California.
对，对，对，对。
Right, right, right, right.
然后我不理解因为
And then I didn't understand cuz
那时我不在乎钱，对吧？
back then I didn't care about money, right?
嗯，
Um,
但现在，显然
but but now, like obviously
我在租房子。
I'm renting my home.
我不认为我会再拥有另一个家
I don't think I'm owning another home
直到我可能65、70岁
until like maybe I'm 65, 70 years old
而且我不再能租房了。
and I'm not able to rent anymore.
嗯，所以分享一下
Um, so share about
为什么你认为租房是
like why you think renting was a
更好的选择。
better choice.
哦，嗯，我是说，单是房产税
Oh, well, I mean, property tax alone
在加州就很贵。
for for California.
如果我们要买房，
If we were to buy something,
嗯，我们的房产税支付。
um, our property tax payment.
而且这只是白白花出去的钱。
And and that's just money going out the door.
每年。
Every year.
每年。
Every year.
嗯，我是说，
Um, I mean,
所以，但我们，
so so that but we,
你知道，说实话，
you know, to be straightforward,
我们确实拥有一个房子。
we do own one home.
那是我们以前住的地方，
And it's it's where we used to live where
我认识你的地方。
I met you.
嗯，但当我们
Um, but when we the
现在住的地方，
place where we live right now,
我们没有拥有房子，我们租的。
we we don't own the home. We rent it.
我们可能，如果我们真想，
We probably, if we really wanted to,
我们可能本来可以买房。
we probably could have bought something.
但是
But
我是说，有实际用途。
I mean, there are practical purposes.
其中一个实际用途是，你知道，
One of the practical purposes is, you know,
我的孩子七岁和八岁。
my kids are seven and eight.
他们真的只会和我们一起
I'm they're really only going to be with us
再过大约10、11年
for maybe about another 10, 11 years
然后他们就去上大学了。
before they go to college.
然后我该怎么办？
And then what what am I going to do?
我要留著这栋大房子干嘛？
What am I going to keep this big house that
我买的房子？
I purchase?
我是说，我猜你
I mean, I guess you
可以把它当作投资，但
could see it as an investment, but
我不知道，我
I I don't know. I
我宁愿支付一半的
I would rather like pay like half
每月付款金额
of what my monthly payment would be
在这段时间内只租房
and just by renting over that period
然后把我本来要支付的钱
rather and and then invest what I would have
拿去投资。
paid.
对吧。
Right.
这样有道理吗？
Does that make sense?
对。
Right.
可能还会赚更多。
And probably make off better.
所以这是我的理论。
So so here's my my theory.
我不确定是否正确。
I'm not sure if it's true.
但我觉得是对的。
I think it's true.
政府和企业界
So the government and corporate
希望人们买房子。
America want people to buy houses.
这是他们的方式，我觉得这只是
This is how they I I think it's just a
一种操控，对吧？
manipulation, right?
他们希望每个人都
So they want they want everybody
买房子。
to buy houses.
原因在于
The reason why is because
比如说企业界，
let's say corporate America,
如果你在谷歌、亚马逊
if you work for Google, Amazon,
这样的大公司工作，
like big companies,
你的薪水通常不错。
um, you have a pretty good salaries.
通常他们会
Normally, they they
先买车，然后买房子，对吧？
first they buy a car and then they buy
对。
houses, right?
一旦他们背上房贷，
And then once they're stuck with a mortgage,
那是30年的房贷，
it's a 30-year mortgage,
你去创业的机会
the chances of you going to
基本上变成零。
create your own business
或者接近于零，
basically becomes zero.
因为你有每月的负担
or or closer to zero
必须支付，对吧？
because you have that monthly burden
所以因为这样，
you have to pay, right?
企业界就能确保
So because of that,
他们总有足够的员工
the corporate America can make sure that
为他们工作。
they always have enough employee
对。
working for them.
他们希望你通过买房
So they want you to stay in middle class
留在中产阶级。
by buying a home.
这有点深奥，但
It's kind of deep, but
确实很深刻，是的。
That's very deep, yes.
但如果你真的
But but but then if you really
仔细想想，确实有道理，
think about it, it really makes sense
因为当你有30年的房贷
because when you have a mortgage
时，
for 30 years,
你就卡住了。
Oh, you're stuck.
你被困住了。
You're stuck.
这就是奴役的定义。
That's the definition of slavery.
对。
Right.
然后当你想
And then when you are want to
探索其他机会时，
when you want to explore other opportunity,
无论是创办自己的生意，
whether it's, uh, create your own business,
还是开自己的店，
open your own shop,
你做不到。
You can't do it.
因为你没有犯错的
Because you don't have the the the
余地。
uh margin for error.
因为你有房贷。
Because you have that mortgage.
没错。
That's right.
这就是我的看法，嗯，
So this is what I believe. Um,
一旦你买了房子，你就
once you buy a house, you're you're
差不多完了。
pretty much done.
我也买过房子。
I I I did buy a house too.
另一个问题是
And then another problem is
大多数人并不
a lot most of people they don't they
这样看待问题。
don't look at it this way.
所以很少有人能
So not many people is able
在同一个地方待上30年。
to stay in the same place for 30 years.
嗯，是的。
Uh, yeah.
现在的世界和过去不同了。
It's a different world than it used to be.
对。比如说，如果你买房子
Right. So for example, if you buy a house
并承担30年的房贷，
and you take on 30 years mortgage,
现在甚至有40年房贷的说法，
they're talking about 40 years mortgage
这真是疯狂。
now, which is crazy.
是啊。
Yeah.
然后你想想看，
And and then you think if
如果你仔细想想，
you think about it,
假设15年后，你想
uh, after 15 years, let's say you want to
换到另一栋房子，
change to a different house,
你已经付了大部分的利息。
you pay majority of the interest already.
是的。
Yes.
你浪费了时间。
You've wasted your time.
对，然后还有
Yeah. And then like
另一件事是首付，对吧？
another thing is down payments, right?
首付可以用来投资
Down payments you can be used to invest
比特币，
in Bitcoin,
也可以投资股票，对吧？
you can be invest in stock, right?
年回报率会
The annual return is
比房地产好。
going to be better than real estate.
房地产平均回报率约4到5%，
Real estate average about 4 to 5%,
标普500是8到10%。
S&P is 8 to 10%.
而且还有流动性。
And then it has liquidity.
你可以卖掉它。
So you can you can sell it.
所以租房是有道理的。
So it makes sense to rent then.
没错。嗯，
Exactly. Um,
然后让我跟你分享我的房子情况，
and then let me share you my my house, right?
我的房子价值大约
The my house is value around like
四百多万。
4 million something.
如果我想租下来，
And then if I want to rent it,
每月租金是7500元。
it's 7,500 per month.
然后我和房东达成协议，
And then I had an agreement with my landlord,
他们会租给我15年。
they're going to do it for 15 years for me.
当然，每年租金
Obviously, every year there's
会有些上涨，
like some increase,
这是合理的。
which is reasonable.
但如果我想买下同一栋房子，
But then if I want to buy the same house,
我得先支付一百万美元
I need to first put down a million dollar
现金作为首付。
cash in down payments.
然后每月还款包括
And then monthly payment including
物业税是25,000元。
property tax is 25,000.
天啊。
Oh my gosh.
这是租金的三倍多
So that's more than triple
对。
Yes.
比租金高。
of the rent.
对啊。
You're yeah.
然后你还得投入
And then you have to put
一百万美元现金作为首付。
a million dollar cash as down payments.
然后你猜怎么著？如果
And then guess what? If
你投入一百万现金
you put a million cash
到，比如说标普500，
in, uh, let's say just S&P 500,
然后你每个月，
and you you have so every month,
如果你是租房，
if you're renting,
你还能省下
you're saving another
大约1.5到1.7万美元。
like 15 to like $17,000.
然后你定投到标普市场，
And then you DCA into the S&P market,
15年或20年后，你会有1600万到1700万。
you'll have 16, 17 million after like
而如果是房子，
15 years, 20 years.
与房子相比，
And then versus like the the the house,
它的价值能增加多少？
how much you can increase in value?
也许从400万涨到550万。
Maybe it goes from 4 million to 5.5.
绝对不会
It's definitely going
达到1600万。
to not going to get you to 16.
对。
Right.
所以这是我的
So this is my my
关于租房与买房的思考方式
my way of thinking in terms of renting
与购买相比。
versus purchasing.
我想如果你有选择，
I I guess if you like if you
有选择的机会，
get to have the choice,
不管是买还是租
rather you want to buy or or rent
与有些人相比，他们
versus somebody they they
他们不把它当作
they don't look at it
一种选择。他们只是
as a choice. They just
被教导要去拥有自己的房子。
they were taught to to own a home.
对。现在我们有很好的
Yeah. I right now we have wonderful
房东很好。
landlords.
我非常感激他们。
And so grateful for them.
嗯，租房的另一个好处是
Um, the other advantage of renting is
当事情发生时，
you don't when when things happen,
如果你有个好房东，
if you have a good landlord,
你可以直接说，抱歉，这个坏了。
you can just say, I'm sorry, this is broken.
能帮忙修一下吗？
Can you help to fix it?
唯一的缺点是，
The the one downside,
就像我之前住的房子，
which is the house that I had before,
我有个很漂亮的花园。
I had this beautiful garden.
因为那是我的。
And it was because it was mine.
你可以随意布置。
You can do whatever you want.
哦，真的很棒。
Oh, it was wonderful.
非常棒。
It was wonderful.
不过这也是
But that's also something
可以和房东协商的。
you can work with the landlord too.
是的，我可以。
Yeah, I could.
只是对我来说
It's hard for it's
改变实际环境比较难。
harder for me to change the actual
土地更是如此。
land though.
我们来谈谈比特币吧
Let let's pivot to uh Bitcoin
还有股票或投资。
and and stock or investing.
我知道安娜买了一些加密货币。
Um, I know Anna has bought some cryptos.
是的。
Yes.
不知道多少
I don't know how much
是听了你的建议。
On your advice.
不知道你对加密货币了解多少。
I don't know how much you know about cryptos.
呃，不多。
Uh, not much.
还是了解不多。
Still not much.
除了和你聊过的内容
Uh, other than what the conversations
之外就没什么了。
I've had with you.
对。所以，我相信比特币
Right. So, uh, I believe Bitcoin
会改变人们的生活。
is going to change people's life.
然后，嗯，
And then, um,
从历史和统计数据来看，
historically, statistically,
它是过去15年来
they are the best
最好的投资。
investment in the past 15 years.
当然，投资时，
Obviously, when you're investing,
绝不要投资
you never invest on
你不了解的东西，对吧？
invest in something you
不了解就别投。
don't understand, right?
那你现在对比特币了解多少？
So what do you know about Bitcoin now?
不多。
Not much.
你这是在考我吗？
Are you putting me on the spot?
我除了
I I don't uh other than
我是说，加密货币，
I mean, cryptocurrency,
我不得不为我的客户稍微研究一下
um, I've had to to kind of delve
这方面的内容。
into it a little bit for my clients.
嗯，
Um,
主要是关于如果我有这些加密货币帐户
um, more on what happens
和其他相关东西，
if I have all these crypto accounts and
如果我过世了，
whatever
会发生什么事，
and I were to pass away, what what
会怎么处理。
would happen.
嗯，
Um,
但是
but
你知道，
you know,
但你有看到趋势吗？
But do you do you see the trend though?
我是说，是的，我看到了趋势。
I mean, I yes, I see the trend.
就像标准普尔指数一样。
It's just like the S&P.
最终还是会上涨。
It ultimately goes up.
但是之前，当我
But but before like when when
第一次谈到这件事时，
I first talk about it.
是的，什么也没有。
Yes, there's nothing.
什么也没有。
There was nothing.
当我们第一次讨论
When we first talked
这个话题，很久很久以前，
about this a long, long time ago,
我当时觉得，哦，这是骗局，
I was like, oh, this is this is a scam, it's
绝对行不通。
never going to work.
但你证明你是对的。干得好。
But you're proven right. Good job.
是啊，看看美国政府
Yeah, see like the US government
也在买进，
is buying it
而且他们也在支持它。
and then they're they're supporting it.
没错。
That's right.
越来越多嗯
got more and more uh
大人物开始支持它。
big time people are getting behind it.
对。然后他们
Right. And then they're
推动天才法案
pushing the genius genius
刚刚通过，
act was just passed,
这就像稳定币法案。
which is like a stable coin bill.
法律上嗯
Like it's legally um
应该在这里合法。
supposed to be like legal here.
然后现在他们正在
And then right now they are
制定市场结构法案
working on market structure bill
和清晰法案，
and clarity act,
这将提供百分之百的透明度，
which is going to provide 100% transparency,
真是太棒了。好吧，那么
which is amazing. Okay, so
假设，嗯，
let's say, um,
好吧，投资。
all right, investing.
所以所以
So so
你的目标是什么
what what what's your goal
未来十年？
for the next 10 year?
我真的很好奇。
I'm really curious.
你有什么目标
Do do you what what's a
未来十年的目标？
goal for the next 10 years for you?
我还在试著弄清楚。
I'm still trying to figure it out.
嗯，我现在正在和我太太讨论，因为
Um, I'm talking to my wife right now because
我已经
I've
我一直在做
I have been doing
嗯，为了未来的储蓄，
um, in order to save for the future,
我一直在做罗斯401k。
I've been doing a Roth 401k.
好。
Okay.
所以这个的优势
And so the advantage
是你现在先缴税
of that is you basically pay the tax now
然后所有的增长，你
and then all the growth, you
未来取出时不用缴税
don't pay any tax on that
那个增长的部分。
growth when you take it out in the future.
我已经存了一大笔
And I've I've got a significant amount
随著时间累积。
saving over time.
我必须非常努力地做到这一点，
I've had to to work hard at that,
非常有纪律。
been very disciplined.
但现在我们到了这个阶段
But now we're at the point where
我和我太太在思考，
my wife and I were thinking,
我们真的想工作多久
how long do we really want to work
才可能想转换
before we kind of maybe want to pivot
到其他事情？
to something else?
还有
And
我们是否应该继续投入罗斯
should we continue to put it into this Roth
401k？
401k?
因为我到58岁半才能动用
Because I can't touch that until 58
那笔钱。
and a half.
好。
Okay.
那他们有改过吗？
So did they did they change it?
我以为是65岁。
I thought it was 65.
嗯，你可以
Uh, you can you can withdraw
在58岁半时无罚款提取。
at 58 and a half without penalty.
好。
Okay.
好。
Okay.
嗯，
Um,
那我应该还是
so should or should
我应该因为我
should I because I I
投入了，你知道，一大笔钱，
put, you know, a significant amount,
大概每月几千元
maybe about a couple grand a month
到这个帐户，这个退休帐户，
into this account, this retirement account,
已经有足够的钱，你知道，
which already has enough, you know,
如果你看数字，它会
if you follow the numbers, it'll
可能在十年内翻倍，对吧？
probably double over 10 years, right?
所以也许我应该把它投入一个投资
So maybe I should put it into an investment
帐户
account
这样更容易取出。
where it's easier to reach into.
但是
But
你得缴税。
you pay taxes.
是的。如果我取出来，我得对收益缴税。
Yes. If I take it out, I pay tax on the gain.
对。
Yeah.
那我还要再工作十年吗？
So am I going to work another 10 years?
因为我48岁，几乎49岁了。
Cuz I'm 48, almost 49.
是吗？
Are you?
对。
Yeah.
哇。
Wow.
我知道，因为我看起来很帅。
I know, it's cuz I look so handsome.
好吧，那么在接下来的十年，
Okay, so so in the next 10 year,
你有没有计划
are you are you still planning
继续经营你的
to run your uh
律师业务？
attorney business?
是的。嗯，你知道，
Yes. Um, you know,
天啊，我到现在已经很努力了。
gosh, I've worked so hard at this point.
我已经做了大约15年。
I'm about 15 years in.
是的。
Yeah.
所以，嗯，很多客户依赖我
So, uh, and a lot of clients depend on me
帮他们完成事情，他们依赖
to get stuff done and they depend on
我的工作和一切。
me for my my work and everything.
所以我不想让那些人
So I don't want to leave those people
感到失望。
out there hanging.
但我也不想工作到70岁
But I also don't want to work till I'm 70
为止。
either.
嗯，我还有其他想做的事。
Um, there's other things I want to do.
我想写作，我想嗯，
I want to write, I want to um,
我想嗯，
I want to uh,
你知道，更参与
you know, be be more involved
孩子们的生活等等。
in my kids' lives and everything.
嗯，
Um,
我觉得这很明智。
I think that's smart.
是的。
Yeah.
因为嗯，看著孩子们长得这么快。
Cuz um, seeing kids growing up so fast.
没错。
That's right.
艾登这个周末就要满六岁了。
Aiden's turning six this weekend.
然后我觉得这六年
And then I just felt like the six
就像一瞬间过去。
year was just like a blur.
我不想错过
And then I don't want to this
这就是为什么我工作
is why like I work
我的工作时间是介于
like my work schedule is between
每周15到25小时
15 to 25 hours
之间。
a week.
因为我不想错过
It's because I don't want to I I
我认为任何金额都不值得
don't think any amount of money is worth
让我错过艾登的
for me to miss out on some of the Aiden's
成长，对吧？
growth, right?
我想参与一切。
I want to be part of like everything.
是的，我同意。
Yeah, I agree.
有些人甚至会
There there are some people that will even
主张
advocate for
如果你在经营生意，
kind of if you're running a business,
可以先放慢生意
kind of putting the brakes on the business
直到你年纪大了
until you're older
孩子们长大了，
and the kids will get out,
但我不想继续
but I don't want to continue to
在年老时工作。那是
work when I'm older. That's
我知道。
I know.
那样的缺点，但
the downside of that, but
我想最后一个问题是
I I I guess the last question is
如果你有机会回去
if you get an opportunity to go back
告诉年轻时的自己，
to tell like yourself,
像是见到自己，
like to meet yourself,
见到年轻的自己
to meet your younger self
在青少年、20多岁，
at at your at the teens, at 20s,
以及30多岁时，
and the at the 30s,
你会告诉他们什么？
like what would you tell them?
我会
I would
我在年轻时就开始投资了。
so I invested when I was young.
好。
Okay.
聪明人。
Smart man.
但是
But
我会鼓励年轻的自己
I would encourage that younger self
更加努力投资。
to do it even more.
好。
Okay.
嗯，
Um,
天啊，我是说，就像我说的，我当时只赚
gosh, I mean like I said, I only made like
每月800美元。
800 bucks a month back then.
所以我想我存了100美元。
So I I think I was saving $100.
你还能存100美元？
You were still able to save $100?
是的，虽然很难，
I it was, I mean,
我当时只吃豆子和米饭。
I was eating beans and rice.
我不是
I wasn't
哇。
Wow.
我是
I was
你知道，你
and you know, you
就像我说的，你会学到很多关于依靠
like I said, you learn a lot about depending
上帝的事。
on God at that time.
你祈祷，然后钱总会以某种方式来到。
You pray and money will come somehow.
所以这是人生中一段美好的时光。
Um, so it's a wonderful time of of life.
但我会，嗯，我会
But I yeah, I would I would
你必须早点开始，因为
you've got to you got to start early because
那个
the the
利息和
the interest and the
复利。
Compound interest.
复利真的很强大。
The compound interest is really powerful.
非常非常强大。
It's incredibly powerful.
是的。
Yeah.
所以
So
另一件事是，嗯，
and the other thing is, um,
你知道，我的父母是很好的人，
you know, my parents were very good people,
但他们在财务方面并不精明
but they weren't really financially savvy
对于这些事情。
when it comes to this stuff.
而且有
And there's there's
年轻时就考虑这些事情
thinking about those things when you're
年轻时
young
并试图学习。
and trying to educate.
所以我在努力帮助我的孩子们
So I'm I'm trying to help my kids
和
and
这是一种平衡
it's this balance
因为你不想只是给
because you don't want to just like give a
孩子钱
kid money
因为那对他们的品格没好处
because that's not going to do anything
对他们的品格。
for their character.
但你也不希望他们对金钱愚蠢
But you also don't want them to be foolish
对金钱
with money
因为这是一个强大的工具
because it's such a powerful tool
去做你想做的事情。
to do the things that you want to do.
是的，复利非常非常
Yeah, compounding is very, very
非常非常强大。
very, very powerful.
很多人只是误解了它。
A lot of people just misunderstood it.
然后，嗯，
And then, um,
尤其是在加密货币投资市场，
especially in the crypto investing market,
很多人只想
um, a lot of people they just want to get
下周就发财。
rich next week.
这不好，因为
Which is bad cuz uh
这就是为什么人们
That's why people
过去也这样看待股票市场。
used to think about the stock market too.
这就是为什么只有
That's why there's only
不到10%的人
10% less than 10% people
能真正持续地
who can actually consistently
在投资世界中赚钱。
make money in the in the world of investing.
这是因为人们总是有那种
It's it's because people always have that
短期视野。
short-term site.
他们总是看著，他们
They always look they
总是想下周发财，
always want to get rich next week,
下个月，明年。
next month, next year.
然后我认为
And then I think
正确的心态是
the the right mindset to have is
你希望到你
how much you want to have by the time you're
50岁时
50
或60岁时拥有多少。
or by the time you're 60.
看长期，看几十年，
Look long-term, look decades,
不是几年，尤其是不是几个月或几周。
not years, especially not month or weeks.
所以，是的，是的，这基本上是
So, yeah, yeah, that that's basically the
那种长期规划
That long-term planning
是我年轻时没有的
is something I did not have
作为一个年轻人。
as a as a young man.
没关系，因为我没有
It's okay cuz I didn't
直到五年前才培养出这种思维。
develop that until five years ago.
我们还有机会变得更好。
We still have a chance to get better.
好。
Okay.
